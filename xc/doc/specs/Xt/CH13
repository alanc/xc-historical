Chapter 13 \- Evolution of The \*(xI
.XE
.LP
The interfaces described by this specification have undergone several
sets of revisions in the course of adoption as an X Consortium
standard specification.  Having now been adopted by the Consortium as
a standard part of the X Window System, it is expected that this and
future revisions will retain
backward compatibility in the sense that fully conforming
implementations of these specifications may be produced that provide
source compatibility with widgets and applications written to
previous Consortium standard revisions.
.LP
The \*(xI do not place any special requirement on widget
programmers to retain source or binary compatibility for their widgets
as they evolve, but several conventions have been established to
assist those developers who want to provide such compatibility.
.LP
In particular, widget programmers may wish to conform to the convention
described in Section 1.6.12 when defining class extension records.

.NH 2
Determining Specification Revision Level
.XS
\fB\*(SN Determining Specification Revision Level\fP
.XE
.LP
Widget and application developers who wish to maintain a common source
pool that will build properly with implementations of the \*(xI
at different revision levels of these specifications but that take
advantage of newer features added in later revisions may use the
symbolic macro
.PN XtSpecificationRelease .
.LP
.Ds 0
#define XtSpecificationRelease 4
.De
.IN "XtSpecificationRelease" "" "@DEF@"
.LP
As the symbol
.PN XtSpecificationRelease
is new to Release 4, widgets and
applications desiring to build against earlier implementations should
test for the presence of this symbol and assume only Release 3
interfaces if the definition is not present.

.NH 2
Release 3 to Release 4 Compatibility
.XS
\fB\*(SN Release 3 to Release 4 Compatibility\fP
.XE
.LP
At the data structure level, Release 4 retains binary compatibility
with Release 3 (the first X Consortium standard release) for all data
structures except
.PN WMShellPart, 
.PN TopLevelShellPart ,
and
.PN TransientShellPart .
Release 4 changed the argument type to most procedures that now take
arguments of type
.PN XtPointer
and structure members that are now of type
.PN XtPointer
in order to avoid potential ANSI C conformance problems.  It is
expected that most implementations will be binary compatible with the
previous definition.
.LP
Two fields in
.PN CoreClassPart
were changed from
.PN Boolean
to
.PN XtEnum
to allow implementations additional freedom in specifying the
representations of each.  This change should require no source
modification.

.NH 3
Additional Arguments
.XS
\fB\*(SN Additional Arguments\fP
.XE
.LP
Arguments were added to the procedure definitions for
.PN XtInitProc ,
.PN XtSetValuesFunc ,
and
.PN XtEventHandler
to provide more information and to
allow event handlers to abort further dispatching of the current event
(caution is advised!).  The added arguments to
.PN XtInitProc
and
.PN XtSetValuesFunc
make the initialize_hook and set_values_hook methods
obsolete, but the hooks have been retained for those widgets that used
them in Release 3.

.NH 3
set_values_almost Procedures
.XS
\*(SN set_values_almost Procedures
.XE
.LP
The use of the arguments by a set_values_almost procedure was poorly
described in Release 3 and was inconsistent with other conventions.
.LP
The current specification for the manner in which a set_values_almost
procedure returns information to the \*(xI is not compatible with
the Release 3 specification, and all widget implementations should
verify that any set_values_almost procedures conform to the current
interface.
.LP
No known implementation of the \*(xI correctly implemented the
Release 3 interface, so it is expected that the impact of this
specification change is small.

.NH 3
Query Geometry
.XS
\*(SN Query Geometry
.XE
.LP
A composite widget layout routine that calls
.PN XtQueryGeometry
is now expected to store the complete new geometry in the intended structure;
previously the specification said ``store the changes it intends to
make''.  Only by storing the complete geometry does the child have
any way to know what other parts of the geometry may still be
flexible.  Existing widgets should not be affected by this, except
to take advantage of the new information.

.NH 3
unrealizeCallback Callback List
.XS
\*(SN unrealizeCallback Callback List
.XE
.LP
In order to provide a mechanism for widgets to be notified when they
become unrealized through a call to
.PN XtUnrealizeWidget ,
the callback
list name ``unrealizeCallback'' has been defined by the \*(xI.  A
widget class that requires notification on unrealize may declare a
callback list resource by this name.  No class is required to declare
this resource, but any class that did so in a prior revision may find
it necessary to modify the resource name if it does not wish to use the new
semantics.

.NH 3
Subclasses of WMShell
.XS
\*(SN Subclasses of WMShell
.XE
.LP
The formal adoption of the \fI\*(xC\fP as
an X Consortium standard has meant the addition of four fields to
.PN WMShellPart
and one field to
.PN TopLevelShellPart .
In deference to some
widget libraries that had developed their own additional conventions
to provide binary compatibility, these five new fields were added at
the end of the respective data structures. 
.LP
To provide more convenience for TransientShells, a field was added
to the previously empty
.PN TransientShellPart .
On some architectures the size of the part structure will not
have changed as a result of this.
.LP
Any widget implementation whose class is a subclass of
TopLevelShell
or
TransientShell
must at minimum be
recompiled with the new data structure declarations.  Because
.PN WMShellPart
no longer contains a contiguous
.PN XSizeHints
data structure,
a subclass that expected to do a single structure assignment of an
.PN XSizeHints
structure to the \fIsize_hints\fP field of
.PN WMShellPart
must be revised, though the old fields remain at the same positions within
.PN WMShellPart .

.NH 3
Resource Type Converters
.XS
\*(SN Resource Type Converters
.XE
.LP
A new interface declaration for resource type converters was defined
to provide more information to converters, to support conversion
cache cleanup with resource reference counting, and to allow
additional procedures to be declared to free resources.  The old
interfaces remain (in the compatibility section) and a new set of
procedures was defined that work only with the new type converter
interface.
.LP
In the now obsolete old type converter interface, converters are
reminded that they must return the size of the converted value as well
as its address.  The example indicated this, but the description of
.PN XtConverter
was incomplete.

.NH 3
KeySym Case Conversion Procedure
.XS
\*(SN KeySym Case Conversion Procedure
.XE
.LP
The specification for the
.PN XtCaseProc
function type has been changed
to match the Release 3 implementation, which included necessary
additional information required by the function (a pointer to the
display connection), and corrects the argument type of the source
KeySym parameter.  No known implementation of the \*(xI
implemented the previously documented interface.

.NH 3
Nonwidget Objects
.XS
\*(SN Nonwidget Objects
.XE
.LP
Formal support for nonwidget objects is new to Release 4.  A
prototype implementation was latent in at least one Release 3
implementation of the \*(xI, but the specification has changed
somewhat.  The most significant change is the requirement for a
composite widget to declare the
.PN CompositeClassExtension
record with the \fIaccepts_objects\fP field set to
.PN True
in order to permit a client to create a nonwidget child.
.LP
The addition of this extension field ensures that composite widgets
written under Release 3 will not encounter unexpected errors if an
application attempts to create a nonwidget child.  In Release 4 there
is no requirement that all composite widgets implement the extra
functionality required to manage windowless children, so the
\fIaccept_objects\fP field allows a composite widget to declare that it
is not prepared to do so.
