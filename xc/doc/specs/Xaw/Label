A Label widget is an noneditable text string or bitmap that is
displayed within a rectangular region of the screen.  The \fBlabel\fP is
limited to one line of Latin1 characters.  The Label widget will
allow its string to be left, right, or center justified.  This widget can
neither be selected nor directly edited by the user.  It is intended
for use as an output device only.
.LP
When creating a Label widget instance, the following resources are
retrieved from the argument list or from the resource database:

.IP accelerators 1.5i
A list of actions to be executed by this widget, even though the
event occurred in another widget.  See section 10.4 in the \fI\*(xT\fP.
.IP ancestorSensitive 1.5i
The sensitivity state of the ancestors of this widget.  A widget is
insensitive if either it or any of its ancestors is insensitive.
This resource is not settable with \fBXtSetValues\fP.  It may
however be queried.
.IP background 1.5i
The background color of this widget.

anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of a background color.
.IP \fBbitmap\fP 1.5i
A bitmap to display instead of a label.  The default size of the
Label will be just large enough to contain the bitmap and the widget's

details on the string to bitmap conversion.
.IP borderColor 1.5i
The color of this widget's border.
.IP borderPixmap 1.5i
The border pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of a background color.
.IP borderWidth 1.5i
This is the width of the border of this widget's window.
.IP colormap 1.5i
The colormap that this widget will use to display all of its colors.

.IP height 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP width 1.5i
The height and width of this widget in pixels.

This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's border if it becomes insensitive.
.IP \fBinternalHeight\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBinternalWidth\fP 1.5i
The minium amount of space to leave between the label or bitmap and the
vertical or horizontal edges of the window.
.IP \fBjustify\fP 1.5i
Specifies left, center, or right alignment of the label 
within the widget.  This resource may be
specified with the values \fBXtJustifyLeft\fP, \fBXtJustifyCenter\fP,
