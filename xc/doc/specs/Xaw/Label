A Label widget is an noneditable text string or bitmap that is
displayed within a rectangular region of the screen.  The \fBlabel\fP is
limited to one line of Latin1 characters.  The Label widget will
allow its string to be left, right, or center justified.  This widget can
neither be selected nor directly edited by the user.  It is intended
for use as an output device only.
.LP
When creating a Label widget instance, the following resources are
retrieved from the argument list or from the resource database:

.IP accelerators 1.5i
A list of actions to be executed by this widget, even though the
event occurred in another widget.  See section 10.4 in the \fI\*(xT\fP.
.IP ancestorSensitive 1.5i
The sensitivity state of the ancestors of this widget.  A widget is
insensitive if either it or any of its ancestors is insensitive.
This resource should not be changed with \fBXtSetValues\fP.  It may,
however, be queried.
.IP background 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifing the background color of the
widget's window.
.IP backgroundPixmap 1.5i
The background pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of the background color.
.IP \fBbitmap\fP 1.5i
A bitmap to display instead of a label.  The default size of the
Label will be just large enough to contain the bitmap and the widget's
internal width and height.  The resource converter for this resource
converts a filename into a bitmap.  See \fBConverting Bitmaps\fP for
details on the string to bitmap conversion.  If this bitmap is one bit
deep then the 1's will be rendered in the foreground color, and the
0's in the background color.  Supported is also provided to copy this
pixmap directly into the window with \fBXCopyArea\fP if \fBbitmap\fP
has a depth greater than 1.
.IP borderColor 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifing the border color of the
widget's window.
.IP borderPixmap 1.5i
The border pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of the border color.
.IP borderWidth 1.5i
This is the width of this widget's border.
.IP colormap 1.5i
The colormap that this widget wants for its window.
.IP cursor 1.5i
The cursor that will be displayed as the mouse pointer, whenever the mouse
pointer is in this widget.
.IP depth 1.5i
The depth of this widgets window.
.IP destroyCallback 1.5i
All callback functions on this list are called when this widget is destroyed.
.IP \fBfont\fP 1.5i
The text font to use when displaying the \fBlabel\fP.
.IP \fBforeground\fP 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifing the color that will be
used to draw the \fBlabel\fP.  This color is also used to render all
1's in \fBbitmap\fP if it is one plane deep. 
.IP height 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP width 1.5i
The height and width of this widget in pixels.
.IP insensitiveBorder 1.5i
This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's border if it becomes insensitive.
.IP \fBinternalHeight\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBinternalWidth\fP 1.5i
The minimum amount of space to leave between the label or bitmap and the
vertical or horizontal edges of the window.
.IP \fBjustify\fP 1.5i
Specifies left, center, or right alignment of the label 
within the widget.  This resource may be
specified with the values \fBXtJustifyLeft\fP, \fBXtJustifyCenter\fP,
or \fBXtJustifyRight\fP.  When specifying the justification from a
resource file the values \fBleft\fP, \fBcenter\fP, or \fBright\fP may be
used.
.IP \fBlabel\fP 1.5i
This is a Latin1 text string to be displayed in the Label's window.
.IP mappedWhenManaged 1.5i
If this resource is \fBTrue\fP then the widget's window will automatically be
mapped by the Toolkit when it is realized and managed.
.IP \fBresize\fP 1.5i
Specifies whether the Label widget should attempt to resize to its
preferred dimensions whenever its resources are modified with
\fBXtSetValues\fP.  This
attempt at a resize is subject to the dictates of the parent of this
widget which is free to resize the MenuButton reguardless of the state
of this resource. 
.IP screen 1.5i
The screen that this widget is displayed on.  This is not a settable resource.
.IP sensitive 1.5i
Whether or not the toolkit will pass events to this widget.  The
widget will not get events if either \fBancestorSensitive\fP or 
\fBsensitive\fP is \fBFalse\fP.
.IP translations 1.5i
The event bindings associated with this widget.
.IP x 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP y 1.5i
The location of the upper lefthand corner of this widget in its parent.
