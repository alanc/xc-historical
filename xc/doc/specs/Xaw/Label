A Label widget is a text string or bitmap displayed within a
rectangular region of the screen.  The \fBlabel\fP may contain
multiple lines of Latin1 characters.  The Label widget will allow its
string to be left, right, or center justified.  Normally, this widget
can be neither selected nor directly edited by the user.  It is
intended for use as an output device only.

When creating a Label widget instance, the following resources are
retrieved from the argument list or from the resource database:

.IP accelerators 1.5i
A list of event to action bindings to be executed by this widget, even
though the event occurred in another widget.  See Section 10.4 in the
\fI\*(xT\fP.
.IP ancestorSensitive 1.5i
The sensitivity state of the ancestors of this widget.  A widget is
insensitive if either it or any of its ancestors is insensitive.
This resource should not be changed with \fBXtSetValues\fP.  It may,
however, be queried.
.IP background 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifying the background color of the
widget's window.
.IP backgroundPixmap 1.5i
The background pixmap of this widget's window..  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP, the pixmap specified will be
used instead of the background color.
.IP \fBbitmap\fP 1.5i
A bitmap to display instead of a label.  The default size of the Label
will be just large enough to contain the bitmap and the widget's
internal width and height.  The resource converter for this resource
constructs bitmaps from the contents of files, given a file name.  See
\fBConverting Bitmaps\fP for details on the string to bitmap
conversion.  If this bitmap is one bit deep then the 1's will be
rendered in the foreground color, and the 0's in the background color.
If \fBbitmap\fP has a depth equal to the depth resource, it is copied
directly into the window.
.IP borderColor 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifying the border color of the
widget's window.
.IP borderPixmap 1.5i
The border pixmap of this widget's window.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP, the pixmap specified will
be used instead of the border color.
.IP borderWidth 1.5i
The width of this widget's window border.
.IP colormap 1.5i
The colormap that this widget will use.
.IP cursor 1.5i
The cursor that will be displayed as the pointer, whenever the pointer
is in this widget.
.IP depth 1.5i
The depth of this widget's window.
.IP destroyCallback 1.5i
All functions on this list are called when this widget is destroyed.
.IP \fBfont\fP 1.5i
The text font to use when displaying the \fBlabel\fP.
.IP \fBforeground\fP 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifying the color that will be
used to draw the \fBlabel\fP.  This color is also used to render all
1's in \fBbitmap\fP if it is one plane deep. 
.IP height 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP width 1.5i
The height and width of this widget in pixels.
.IP insensitiveBorder 1.5i
This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's border if the widget becomes
insensitive.
.IP \fBinternalHeight\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBinternalWidth\fP 1.5i
The minimum amount of space to leave between the label or bitmap and the
vertical and horizontal edges of the window.
.IP \fBjustify\fP 1.5i
Specifies left, center, or right alignment of the label within the
widget.  This resource may be specified with the values
\fBXtJustifyLeft\fP, \fBXtJustifyCenter\fP, or \fBXtJustifyRight\fP.
When specifying the justification from a resource file the values
\fBleft\fP, \fBcenter\fP, or \fBright\fP may be used.  This resource
only has noticable effect when the width of the widget is larger than
necessary.
.IP \fBlabel\fP 1.5i
This is a Latin1 text string to be displayed in the Label's window.
.IP mappedWhenManaged 1.5i
If this resource is \fBTrue\fP, then the widget's window will
automatically be mapped by the Toolkit when it is realized and managed.
.IP \fBresize\fP 1.5i
Specifies whether the Label widget should attempt to resize to its
preferred dimensions whenever its resources are modified with
\fBXtSetValues\fP.  This attempt to resize may be denied by the parent
of this widget.  Also, the parent is free to resize the widget
regardless of the state of this resource.
.IP screen 1.5i
The screen on which this widget is displayed.  This is not a settable
resource.
.IP sensitive 1.5i
Whether or not the toolkit will pass user events to this widget.  The
widget will not get input events if either \fBancestorSensitive\fP or 
\fBsensitive\fP is \fBFalse\fP.
.IP translations 1.5i
The event bindings associated with this widget.
.IP x 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP y 1.5i
The location of the upper left outside corner of this widget in its parent.
