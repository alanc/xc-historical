The Text widget the glue that binds all the other pieces together, it
maintains the internal state of the displayed text, and acts as a
mediator between the source and sink.

.IP accelerators 1.5i
A list of actions to be executed by this widget, even though the
event occurred in another widget.  See section 10.4 in the \fI\*(xT\fP.
.IP ancestorSensitive 1.5i
The sensitivity state of the ancestors of this widget.  A widget is
insensitive if either it or any of its ancestors is insensitive.
This resource should not be changed with \fBXtSetValues\fP.  It may,
however, be queried.
.IP background 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifing the background color of the
widget's window.
.IP backgroundPixmap 1.5i
The background pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of the background color.
.IP borderColor 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifing the border color of the
widget's window.
.IP borderPixmap 1.5i
The border pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of the border color.
.IP borderWidth 1.5i
This is the width of this widget's border.
.IP \fBbottomMargin\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBleftMargin\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBrightMargin\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBtopMargin\fP 1.5i
The amount of space, in pixels, between the edge of the window
and the corresponding edge of the text within the window.  If there is
a scrollbar active on this edge, then this is the space between the text and
the scrollbar. 
.IP colormap 1.5i
The colormap that this widget wants for its window.
.IP cursor 1.5i
The cursor that will be displayed as the mouse pointer, whenever the mouse
pointer is in this widget.
.IP depth 1.5i
The depth of this widgets window.
.IP destroyCallback 1.5i
All callback functions on this list are called when this widget is destroyed.
.IP \fBdisplayCaret\fP 1.5i
Specifies whether or not to display the text insert cursor.  
.IP \fBdisplayPosition\fP 1.5i
The position in the text buffer of the character that is currently
displayed in the upper left hand corner of the text display.
.IP height 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP width 1.5i
The height and width of this widget in pixels.
.IP insensitiveBorder 1.5i
This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's border if it becomes insensitive.
.IP \fBinsertPosition\fP 1.5i
This is the location of the insert cursor.  It is expressed in
characters from the beginning of the file.  The cursor will always be
forced to be on the screen.  This resource may therefore be used to
scroll the text display to a certain character position.
.IP mappedWhenManaged 1.5i
If this resource is \fBTrue\fP then the widget's window will automatically be
mapped by the Toolkit when it is realized and managed.
.IP \fBresize\fP 1.5i
Controls whether the text widget attempts to resize itself when it is
no longer able to display the full text buffer in the window it
currently has.  This attempt is subject to the geometry manager of the
text widget's parent, of course.  The values \fBXawtextResizeNever\fP,
\fBXawtextResizeWidth\fP, \fBXawtextResizeHeight\fP, and
\fBXawtextResizeBoth\fP are all acceptable for this resource.  A type
converter has been registered to accept the strings \fBnever\fP,
\fBwidth\fP, \fBheight\fP, and \fBboth\fP for this resource, when
specified in the resource database.
.IP screen 1.5i
The screen that this widget is displayed on.  This is not a settable resource.
.IP \fBscrollHorizontal\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBscrollVertical\fP 1.5i
These resources control the placement of scrollbars on the left and
bottom edge of the text widget.  These resources accept
values \fBXawtextScrollAlways\fP, \fBXawtextScrollWhenNeeded\fP, and
\fBXawtextScrollNever\fP.  A type converter is registered to convert
the values \fBalways\fP, \fBwhenNeeded\fP, and \fBnever\fP to the proper
\fBXawScrollMode\fP.  If \fBwhenNeeded\fP is specified the appropriate
scrollbar will only appear when there is text in the buffer that is
not able to fit within the bounds of the current window.  The
scrollbar will disappear when the text once again fits within the window.
.IP \fBselectTypes\fP 1.5i
Specifies the selection type array that is used when
multi click is activated (see \fBText Selections for Application
Programmers\fP for details).  This resource is used in place, and must
not be freed until the Text widget is destroyed.  There is no
type converter registered for this resource, so it may not be set from
the resource manager. 
.IP sensitive 1.5i
Whether or not the toolkit will pass events to this widget.  The
widget will not get events if either \fBancestorSensitive\fP or 
\fBsensitive\fP is \fBFalse\fP.
.IP \fBtextSink\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBtextSink\fP 1.5i
The widget pointer to the TextSink or TextSource object that this widget is
currently using.  These resources must be set to a valid source and
sink before the Text widget is realized.
.IP translations 1.5i
The event bindings associated with this widget.
.IP \fBwrap\fP 1.5i
When the text in any one line is wider than the window there are
several possible actions.  This resource allows the user to decide
what will happen.  The accepted values for this resource
are \fBXawtextWrapNever\fP, \fBXawtextWrapLine\fP, and \fBXawtextWrapWord\fP.
With \fBXawtextWrapLine\fP is enabled all text that is too long to fit
on a line will be dropped onto the next line.  The break will occur
at the window edge.  With \fBXawtextWrapWord\fP the same action
occures but the text is broken at a word boundary if at all possible.
If no wrapping is enabled then the text will just extend off the edge
of the window, and a small rectangle will be painted in the right
margin to alert the user to the fact that the line is too long.
A type converter is registered that accepts \fBnever\fP, \fBword\fP, and
\fBline\fP as good values for this resource.
.IP x 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP y 1.5i
The location of the upper lefthand corner of this widget in its parent.
