Chapter 7 - Menus
.XE
.LP
The Athena widget set provides support for single paned non-hierarchal
popup and pulldown menus.  We realized the support for menus must be
provided in even  
the most basic of widget sets, and that this has long been perceived as
a serious flaw in the Athena widget set.  Since the resources
avaliable for this task were limited we decided to provide only the
basic functionality, and deliberately not attempt to solve the entire problem.
.LP
Menus in the Athena widget set implement a Menu container (the
SimpleMenu widget) and a collection of objects that will comprise the
menu entries.  The SimpleMenu widget is itself a direct subclass of the
OverrideShell widget class.  No other shell is necessary when
creating a menu.  The managed children of a SimpleMenu must be
subclasses of the Sme (Simple Menu Entry) object.
.LP
The Athena widget set provides three classes of Sme Objects that may
be used to build menus.
.IP Sme 1i
The base class of all menu entries, it may be used as a menu
entry itself to provide blank space in a menu.
.IP SmeBSE 1i
Provides support for a menu string, as well as a bitmap in each of the
margins. 
.IP SmeLine 1i
A seperator line may be placed in a menu by using this object class.
.LP
The SimpleMenu widget sets the \fBOverrider Redirect\fP flag to
tell the window manager to ignore its window.  This behavior is fine
for the click-drag-release style of menu operation, but if you desire
click-move-click or \fIpinable\fP menues you should be sure to set up
the resources to allow the window manager to \fIsee\fP the menu.
.LP
To allow easy creation of pulldown menus a MenuButton widget is
also provided as part of the Athena widget set.

Using the Menus
.LP
The default configuration for the menus is click-move-release, and it is
this interface that I will describe.  The menus will
typically be activated by clicking the mouse while the pointer is over
a menu button, causing the menu to appear in a fixed location 
relative to that button; this is a \fBpulldown\fP menu.  Menus also are often
activated when a specific mouse and key sequence is used anywhere in
the application; this is a \fBpopup\fP menu (e.g. clicking Ctrl-<left
mouse button> in xterm).  In 
this case the menu will position itself under the cursor. Typically
the cursor will be on the first menu entry, or on the last entry the
user selected.  
.LP
The menu will remain on the screen as long as the mouse button is held
down.  Moving the mouse will select (highlight) different menu items.
If the mouse pointer leaves the menu, or moves over an entry that cannot
be selected then no menu entry will selected.  When the desired menu
entry has been selected, release the mouse button to remove the menu,
and cause the function associated with this entry to be invoked.
