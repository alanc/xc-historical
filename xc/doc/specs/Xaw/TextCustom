The remainder of this chapter will describe customizing the Text
widget.  The Text widget may be customized by subclassing, or by
creating new sources and sinks.  Subclassing is described in
detail in Chapter 7, this section will describe only those things that
are specific to the Text widget.  Attributes of the Text widget base
class and creating new sources and sinks will be discussed.
.LP
The Text widget is made up of a number of different pieces, with the
Text widget as the base widget class.  It and the AsciiText widget are
the only true "widgets" in the Text widget family.  The other pieces
(sources and sinks) are X Toolkit objects and have no window
associated with them.  No source or sink is useful unless assigned to
a Text widget.
.LP
Each of the following pieces of the Text widget has a specific purpose,
and will be, or has been, discussed in detail in this chapter:
.IN "Text Widget" ""
.IP \fBText\fP 15 
This is the glue that binds everything else together.  This widget reads
the text data from the source, and displays the information in the sink.
All translations and actions are handled in the Text widget itself.
.IN "TextSink Object" ""
.IP \fBTextSink\fP 15 
This object is responsible for displaying and clearing the drawing area.
It also reports the configuration of the window that contains the
drawing area.  The TextSink does not have its own window, instead it does
its drawing on the Text widget's window. 
.IN "TextSource Object" ""
.IP \fBTextSource\fP 15 
This object is responsible for reading, editing and searching through the
text buffer.  This bugger can be any source of information that this
particular TextSource knows how to read. 
.IN "AsciiSink Object" ""
.IP \fBAsciiSink\fP 15
This object is a subclass of the TextSink and knows how to display
ASCII text.  Support has been added to display 8-bit characters.
.IN "AsciiSource Object" ""
.IP \fBAsciiSource\fP 15
This object is a subclass of the TextSource and knows how to read strings
and files.
.IN "AsciiText Widget" ""
.IP \fBAsciiText\fP 15
This widget is a subclass of the Text widget that automatically attaches
an AsciiSource and AsciiSink to itself at creation time.  This widget
provides the simplest interface to the AthenaText widget.
