The SmeLine object is used to add a
horizontal line or menu seperator to a menu.  Since each menu entry is
an independant object, the application is able to change the color,
height, and other attributes of the menu entries, on an individual
basis.  This entry is not selectable, and will not highlight when the
mouse pointer is over it.

.IP destroyCallback 1.5i
All callback functions on this list are called when this object is destroyed.
.IP \fBforeground\fP 1.5i
The color of the line.

.IP width 1.5i
The height and width of this object in pixels.  Keep in mind that the
SimpleMenu widget will force all menu items to be the width of the
widest entry.  Thus the width is generally not very important.
.IP \fBlineWidth\fP 1.5i
The width of the horizontal line that is to be displayed.
.IP \fBstipple\fP 1.5i
If a bitmap is specifed for this resource the line will be stippled
through this pixmap.  This allows the menu separator to be rendered
as something more exciting than just a line.  For instance if you
define a stipple that is a chain link then your menu serperators will
be look like chains.  The upper left corner of the stipple will be set
to the upper left corner of the line.
