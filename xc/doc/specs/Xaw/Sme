The Sme object is the base class for all menu entries.  While this
object is mainly intended to be subclassed, it may be used in a menu to
add blank space between menu entries.

Resources
.IN "SmeLine object" "resources"
.LP
The resources associated with the SmeLine object are defined in this section,
and affect only the single menu entry specified by this object.  There
a no new resources added for this class, it pickes up all its
resources from the RectObj class.

Subclassing the Sme Object
.IN "Sme object" "Subclassing" "@DEF"
.LP
.sp
To Create a new Sme object you will need to define a few class procedures.
These proceedures allow the SimpleMenu to highlight, and unhighlight the
menu entry as the mouse pointer moves over it, as well as notifying the
entry when the user has selected it.
.LP
There are three new class methods defined by the Sme Object.
All of these methods may be inherited from the Sme object, although the
default semantics are not very interesting.
.IP \fBHighlight\fP(\|) 1i
Called when the SimpleMenu wishes to notify the user that this menu
entry is ready to be selected.
.IP \fBUnhighlight\fP(\|) 1i
Called to return the widget to its normal (unhighlighted) state.
.IP \fBNotify\fP(\|) 
Called when the user selects this menu entry.
.LP
.sp
Other then these specialized class procedures creating a new object
should be straight forward.  It is just a matter of subclassing
Sme and defining your own redisplay and highlight procedures.  Here are
some tips to remember.
.IP 1) 3n
Objects can be zero pixels high.
.IP 2) 3n
Objects draw on their parents window, so, for instance, the y
locations you should use vary from \fBy\fP to \fBy + height\fP, not \fB0\fP to
\fBheight\fP. 
.IP 3) 3n
SetValues calls may come from the application when in the notify
proceedure, you will get an \fBunhighlight\fP after this, but before
the expose event generated by \fBXtSetValues\fP so be careful.
.IP 4) 3n
Remember you do not own the window, be sure to share the space with other
menu entries.  Never draw outside your own section of the menu.
