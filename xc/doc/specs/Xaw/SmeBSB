The SmeBSB object is used to create
a menu entry that contains a string, and optional bitmaps in its
margins.  Since each menu entry is an independant object, the
pplication is able to change the font, color, height, and other
attributes of the menu entries, on an individual basis.

.As
.IP \fBcallback\fP 1.5i
All callback functions on this list are called when the SimpleMenu
\fInotifies\fP this entry that the user has selected it.
.De
.IP \fBfont\fP 1.5i
The font used to display the text label.
.IP \fBforeground\fP 1.5i
An index into SimpleMenu's colormap specifing the color that will be
used to draw the \fBlabel\fP.  This color is also used to render all
1's in the left and right bitmaps.
.Hw
Keep in mind that the SimpleMenu widget will force the width of all
menu entries to be the width of the longest entry.
.IP \fBjustify\fP 1.5i
How the label is to be rendered between the left and right margins when
the space is wider than the actual text.  This resource may be
specified with the values \fBXtJustifyLeft\fP, \fBXtJustifyCenter\fP,
or \fBXtJustifyRight\fP.  When specifying the justification from a
resource file the values \fBleft\fP, \fBcenter\fP, or \fBright\fP may be
used.
.IP \fBlabel\fP 1.5i
This is a the string that will be displayed in the menu entry.  The exact
location of this string within the bounds of the menu entry is
controlled by the \fBleftMargin\fP, \fBrightMargin\fP,
\fBvertSpace\fP, and \fBjustify\fP resources.
.IP \fBleftBitmap\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBrightBitmap\fP 1.5i
This is a name of a bitmap to display in the left or right margin of the
menu entry.  All 1's in the bitmap will be rendered in the foreground
color, and all 0's will be drawn in the background color of the
SimpleMenu widget.  It is the
programmers responsibility to make sure that the menu entry is tall
enough, and the appropriate margin wide enough to accept the bitmap.
If care is not taken the bitmap may extend into another menu entry, or
into this entry's label.
.IP \fBleftMargin\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBrightMargin\fP 1.5i
This is the amount of space (in pixels) that will be left between the
edge of the menu entry and the label string.
.Se
.IP \fBvertSpace\fP 1.5i
This is the amount of extra space, as a percentage of the font height,
that is to be added to the font height to determine the default height
of the menu entry. The label and bitmaps are always vertically
rendered in the center of the menu.  The default value for this
resource (25) causes the default height to be 125% of the height of the
font.  Negative numbers may be specified.
