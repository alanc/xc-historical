The AsciiText widget is really a collection of smaller parts, it
includes the Text widget, an AsciiSource, and an AsciiSink.  Some of
the resources listed below are not actually resources of the
AsciiText, but belong to the AsciiSource or AsciiSink.  This is
is noted in the explanation of each resource where it applies.  When
specifying these resources in a resource file be sure to use
\fI*AsciiText*resource_name\fP instead of
\fI*AsciiText.resource_name\fP, since they actually belong to the
children of the AsciiText widget, and not the AsciiText widget itself.
These resources may be set directly on the AsciiText widget at widget
creation time, or via \fBXtSetValues\fP, however.

.IP accelerators 1.5i
A list of actions to be executed by this widget, even though the
event occurred in another widget.  See section 10.4 in the \fI\*(xT\fP.
.IP ancestorSensitive 1.5i
The sensitivity state of the ancestors of this widget.  A widget is
insensitive if either it or any of its ancestors is insensitive.
This resource is not settable with \fBXtSetValues\fP.  It may
however be queried.
.IP \fBautoFill\fP 1.5i
If this resource is True the text widget will automatically break a
line when the user attempts to type into the right margin.  The
attribute has no effect on files or text 
inserted into the text widget.  It only checks to see if the action should be
taken when a user enters a new character via the
\fIinsert-character\fP action.
.IP background 1.5i
The background color of this widget.
.IP backgroundPixmap 1.5i
The background pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of a background color.
.IP borderColor 1.5i
The color of this widget's border.
.IP borderPixmap 1.5i
The border pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of a background color.
.IP borderWidth 1.5i
This is the width of the border of the AsciiText's widget.
.IP \fBbottomMargin\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBleftMargin\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBrightMargin\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBtopMargin\fP 1.5i
The amount of space, in pixels, between the edge of the window
and the corresponding edge of the text within the window.  If there is
a scrollbar active on this edge, then this is the space between the text and
the scrollbar. 
.IP \fBcallback\fP 1.5i
The callbacks registered on this resource will be called everytime the
text buffer changes.  This is an AsciiSource Resource.
.IP colormap 1.5i
The colormap that this widget will use to display all of its colors.
.IP cursor 1.5i
The cursor that will be displayed as the mouse pointer, whenever the mouse
pointer is in this widget.
.IP \fBdataCompression\fP 1.5i
The AsciiSource uses an algorithm that over time as the text is edited
may cause the text buffer to grow to about twice the size of the
actual text.  On systems where time is cheaper than memory it is
helpful to spend some extra time to compress this buffer back to its
minium size.  If this resource is \fBTrue\fP, every time the text string is
saved, or the value of the string is queried the AsciiSource will take
the time to compress its data to the minium size required.  This is an
AsciiSource resource.
.IP depth 1.5i
The depth of this widgets window.
.IP destroyCallback 1.5i
All callback functions on this list are called when this widget is destroyed.
.IP \fBdisplayCaret\fP 1.5i
Specifies whether or not to display the text insert cursor.  
.IP \fBdisplayNonprinting\fP 1.5i
If \fBTrue\fP the text widget will display all non-printable
characters as the string \fI^@\fP.  If \fBFalse\fP the text widget
will just leave a blank space where a non-printable character exists
in the text buffer.  This is an AsciiSink resource.
.IP \fBdisplayPosition\fP 1.5i
The position in the text buffer of the character that is currently
displayed in the upper left hand corner of the text display.
.IP \fBecho\fP 1.5i
Whether or not to echo characters to the screen.  You can still edit
the buffer, but nothing is displayed.  This mode can be useful for
entering passwords and other sensitive information.  This is an
AsciiSink resource.
.IP \fBeditType\fP 1.5i
This is the type of editing that will be allowed in this text widget.
Acceptable values are \fBXawtextRead\fP, \fBXawtextEdit\fP, and
\fBXawtextAppend\fP.  A type converter is registered that will convert
the strings \fBread\fP, \fBedit\fP, and \fBappend\fP to the proper
\fBXawEditType\fP.  This is an AsciiSource resource.
.IP \fBfont\fP 1.5i
The font for rendering all text.  This font must be a character cell
font.  This is an AsciiSink resource.
.IP \fBforeground\fP 1.5i
The foreground color of all text displayed in this widget.  This is an
AsciiSink resource. 
.IP height 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP width 1.5i
The height and width of this widget in pixels.
.IP insensitiveBorder 1.5i
This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's border if it becomes insensitive.
.IP \fBinsertPosition\fP 1.5i
This is the location of the insert cursor.  It is expressed in
characters from the beginning of the file.  The cursor will always be
forced to be on the screen.  This resource may therefore be used to
scroll the text display to a certain character position.
.IP \fBlength\fP 1.5i
If the \fBuseStringInPlace\fP resource is \fBFalse\fP this attribute has no
effect.  If that resource is \fBTrue\fP, however, then the \fBlength\fP
resource specifies the length of the buffer passed to the text widget
in the \fBstring\fP resource.  This is an AsciiSource Resource.
.IP mappedWhenManaged 1.5i
If this resource is \fBTrue\fP then the widget will automatically be
mapped by the Toolkit when it is realized and managed.
.IP \fBpieceSize\fP 1.5i
This is the size of the internal chunks that the text is broken down
into for memory management.  The larger this value the less segmented
your memory will be, but the slower your editing will be.  The text
widgets will always allocate a chunk of memory this size to stuff the
\fBstring\fP into, so when using small strings, having this buffer
large can waste memory.  This resource has no effect if
\fBuseStringInPlace\fP is \fBTrue\fP.  This is an AsciiSource resource.
.IP \fBresize\fP 1.5i
Controls whether the text widget attempts to resize itself when it is
no longer able to display the full text buffer in the window it
currently has.  This attempt is subject to the geometry manager of the
text widget's parent, of course.  The values \fBXawtextResizeNever\fP,
\fBXawtextResizeWidth\fP, \fBXawtextResizeHeight\fP, and
\fBXawtextResizeBoth\fP are all acceptable for this resource.  A type
converter has been registered to accept the strings \fBnever\fP,
\fBwidth\fP, \fBheight\fP, and \fBboth\fP for this resource, when
specified in the resource database.
.IP screen 1.5i
The screen that this widget is displayed on.  This is not a settable resource.
.IP \fBscrollHorizontal\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBscrollVertical\fP 1.5i
These resources control the placement of scrollbars on the left and
bottom edge of the text widget.  These resources accept
values \fBXawtextScrollAlways\fP, \fBXawtextScrollWhenNeeded\fP, and
\fBXawtextScrollNever\fP.  A type converter is registered to convert
the values \fBalways\fP, \fBwhenNeeded\fP, and \fBnever\fP to the proper
\fBXawScrollMode\fP.  If \fBwhenNeeded\fP is specified the appropriate
scrollbar will only appear when there is text in the buffer that is
not able to fit within the bounds of the current window.  The
scrollbar will disappear when the text once again fits within the window.
.IP \fBselectTypes\fP 1.5i
Specifies the selection type array that is used when
multi click is activated (see \fBText Selections for Application
Programmers\fP for details).  This resource is used in place, and must
not be freed until the AsciiText widget is destroyed.  There is no
type converter registered for this resource, so it may not be set from
the resource manager. 
.IP sensitive 1.5i
Whether or not the toolkit will pass events to this widget.  The
widget will not get events if either \fBancestorSensitive\fP or 
\fBsensitive\fP is \fBFalse\fP.
.IP \fBstring\fP 1.5i
If the AsciiText widget is of type \fBXawAsciiString\fP then this string
contains the buffer to be displayed in the AsciiText widget. 
If the AsciiText widget is of type \fBXawAsciiFile\fP then the
string contains the name of the file to be displayed.  This string is
normally copied by the text widget into internal memory, but
may be used in place by setting the \fBuseStringInPlace\fP resource.
As of X11R4 this is a settable resource.  This is an
AsciiSource resource.
.IP \fBtextSink\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBtextSink\fP 1.5i
The widget pointer to the TextSink or TextSource object that this widget is
currently using.  The AsciiText widget initializes these resources to point
to an AsciiSink and AsciiSource respectively.
.IP translation 1.5i
The translations associated with this widget.
.IP \fBtype\fP 1.5i
This resource may be either \fBXawAsciiString\fP or
\fBXawAsciiFile\fP.  The value of this resource determines whether the
\fBstring\fP contains the name of a file to be opened or a buffer to
be displayed by the text widget.  A converter has been registered for
this resource and accepts the values \fBstring\fP and \fBfile\fP.
This is an AsciiSource resource.
.IP \fBuseStringInPlace\fP 1.5i
While having the AsciiText widget perform dynamic memory management
makes the programers job much easier, and is very helpful for most
tasks there are times when it just gets in the way.
In these cases by setting this resource to \fBTrue\fP the AsciiText
widget will use the \fBstring\fP in place.  Be
sure to set the \fBtype\fP resource to size of the buffer allocated
by the application.  If the \fBstring\fP is used in place then it must
exist for the lifetime of the text widget, or until it has been reset.
This is an AsciiSource resource. 
.IP \fBwrap\fP 1.5i
When the text in any one line is wider than the window there are
several possible actions.  This resource allows the user to decide
what will happen.  The accepted values for this resource
are \fBXawtextWrapNever\fP, \fBXawtextWrapLine\fP, and \fBXawtextWrapWord\fP.
With \fBXawtextWrapLine\fP is enabled all text that is too long to fit
on a line will be dropped onto the next line.  The break will occur
at the window edge.  With \fBXawtextWrapWord\fP the same action
occures but the text is broken at a word boundary if at all possible.
If no wrapping is enabled then the text will just extend off the edge
of the window, and a small rectangle will be painted in the right
margin to alert the user to the fact that the line is too long.
A type converter is registered that accepts \fBnever\fP, \fBword\fP, and
\fBline\fP as good values for this resource.
.IP x 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP y 1.5i
The location of the upper lefthand corner of this widget in its parent.
