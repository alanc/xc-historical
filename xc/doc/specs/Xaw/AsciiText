The AsciiText widget is really a collection of smaller parts.  It
includes the Text widget, an AsciiSource, and an AsciiSink.  Some of
the resources listed below are not actually resources of the
AsciiText, but belong to the AsciiSource or AsciiSink.  This is
is noted in the explanation of each resource where it applies.  When
specifying these resources in a resource file be sure to use
\fI*AsciiText*resource_name\fP instead of
\fI*AsciiText.resource_name\fP, since they actually belong to the
children of the AsciiText widget, and not the AsciiText widget itself.
However, these resources may be set directly on the AsciiText widget at
widget creation time, or via \fBXtSetValues\fP.

.IP accelerators 1.5i
A list of actions to be executed by this widget, even though the
event occurred in another widget.  See section 10.4 in the \fI\*(xT\fP.
.IP ancestorSensitive 1.5i
The sensitivity state of the ancestors of this widget.  A widget is
insensitive if either it or any of its ancestors is insensitive.
This resource should not be changed with \fBXtSetValues\fP.  It may,
however, be queried.
.IP autoFill 1.5i
If this resource is \fBTrue\fP the text widget will automatically break a line
when the user attempts to type into the right margin.  The attribute has
no effect on files or text inserted into the text widget.  It only
checks to see if the action should be taken when a user enters a new
character via the \fIinsert-character\fP action.
.IP background 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifying the background color of the
widget's window.
.IP backgroundPixmap 1.5i
The background pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of the background color.
.IP bitmap 1.5i
A bitmap to display instead of a label.  The default size of the
Label will be just large enough to contain the bitmap and the widget's
internal width and height.  The resource converter for this resource
converts a filename into a bitmap.  See \fBConverting Bitmaps\fP for
details on the string to bitmap conversion.  If this bitmap is one bit
deep then the 1's will be rendered in the foreground color, and the
0's in the background color.  Support is also provided to copy this
pixmap directly into the window with \fBXCopyArea\fP if \fBbitmap\fP
has a depth greater than 1.
.IP borderColor 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifying the border color of the
widget's window.
.IP borderPixmap 1.5i
The border pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of the border color.
.IP borderWidth 1.5i
This is the width of this widget's border.
.IP bottomMargin 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP leftMargin 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP rightMargin 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP topMargin 1.5i
The amount of space, in pixels, between the edge of the window
and the corresponding edge of the text within the window.  If there is
a scrollbar active on this edge, then this is the space between the text and
the scrollbar. 
.IP callback 1.5i
The callbacks registered on this resource will be called every time the
text buffer changes.  This is an AsciiSource Resource.
.IP colormap 1.5i
The colormap that this widget wants for its window.
.IP cursor 1.5i
The cursor that will be displayed as the mouse pointer, whenever the mouse
pointer is in this widget.
.IP dataCompression 1.5i
The AsciiSource uses an algorithm that may cause the text buffer to grow
to about twice the size of the actual text over time, as the text is
edited.  On systems where time is cheaper than memory, it is helpful to
spend some extra time to compress this buffer back to its minimum size.
If this resource is \fBTrue\fP, the AsciiSource will compress its data
to the minimum size required every time the text string is saved, or the
value of the string is queried.  This is an AsciiSource resource.
.IP depth 1.5i
The depth of this widget's window.
.IP destroyCallback 1.5i
All callback functions on this list are called when this widget is destroyed.
.IP displayCaret 1.5i
Specifies whether or not to display the text insert cursor.  
.IP displayNonprinting 1.5i
If \fBTrue\fP the text widget will display all non-printable
characters as the string \fI^@\fP.  If \fBFalse\fP the text widget
will just leave a blank space where a non-printable character exists
in the text buffer.  This is an AsciiSink resource.
.IP displayPosition 1.5i
The position in the text buffer of the character that is currently
displayed in the upper left hand corner of the text display.
.IP echo 1.5i
Whether or not to echo characters to the screen.  You can still edit
the buffer, but nothing is displayed.  This mode can be useful for
entering passwords and other sensitive information.  This is an
AsciiSink resource.
.IP editType 1.5i
This is the type of editing that will be allowed in this text widget.
Acceptable values are \fBXawtextRead\fP, \fBXawtextEdit\fP, and
\fBXawtextAppend\fP.  A type converter is registered that will convert
the strings \fBread\fP, \fBedit\fP, and \fBappend\fP to the proper
\fBXawEditType\fP.  This is an AsciiSource resource.
.IP font 1.5i
The font for rendering all text.  This font must be a character cell
font.  This is an AsciiSink resource.
.IP foreground 1.5i
The foreground color of all text displayed in this widget.  This is an
AsciiSink resource. 
.IP height 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP width 1.5i
The height and width of this widget in pixels.
.IP insensitiveBorder 1.5i
This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's border if it becomes insensitive.
.IP insertPosition 1.5i
This is the location of the insert cursor.  It is expressed in
characters from the beginning of the file.  The cursor will always be
forced to be on the screen.  This resource may therefore be used to
scroll the text display to a certain character position.
.IP length 1.5i
If the \fBuseStringInPlace\fP resource is \fBFalse\fP this attribute has no
effect.  If that resource is \fBTrue\fP, however, then the \fBlength\fP
resource specifies the length of the buffer passed to the text widget
in the \fBstring\fP resource.  This is an AsciiSource Resource.
.IP mappedWhenManaged 1.5i
If this resource is \fBTrue\fP then the widget's window will automatically be
mapped by the Toolkit when it is realized and managed.
.IP pieceSize 1.5i
This is the size of the internal chunks that the text is broken down
into for memory management.  The larger this value the less segmented
your memory will be, but the slower your editing will be.  The text
widgets will always allocate a chunk of memory this size to stuff the
\fBstring\fP into, so when using small strings, having this buffer
large can waste memory.  This resource has no effect if
\fBuseStringInPlace\fP is \fBTrue\fP.  This is an AsciiSource resource.
.IP resize 1.5i
Controls whether the text widget attempts to resize itself when it is
no longer able to display the full text buffer in the window it
currently has.  This attempt is subject to the geometry manager of the
text widget's parent, of course.  The values \fBXawtextResizeNever\fP,
\fBXawtextResizeWidth\fP, \fBXawtextResizeHeight\fP, and
\fBXawtextResizeBoth\fP are all acceptable for this resource.  A type
converter has been registered to accept the strings \fBnever\fP,
\fBwidth\fP, \fBheight\fP, and \fBboth\fP for this resource, when
specified in the resource database.
.IP screen 1.5i
The screen that this widget is displayed on.  This is not a settable resource.
.IP scrollHorizontal 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP scrollVertical 1.5i
These resources control the placement of scrollbars on the left and
bottom edge of the text widget.  These resources accept
values \fBXawtextScrollAlways\fP, \fBXawtextScrollWhenNeeded\fP, and
\fBXawtextScrollNever\fP.  A type converter is registered to convert
the values \fBalways\fP, \fBwhenNeeded\fP, and \fBnever\fP to the proper
\fBXawScrollMode\fP.  If \fBwhenNeeded\fP is specified the appropriate
scrollbar will only appear when there is text in the buffer that is
not able to fit within the bounds of the current window.  The
scrollbar will disappear when the text once again fits within the window.
.IP selectTypes 1.5i
Specifies the selection type array that is used when
multi-click is activated (see \fBText Selections for Application
Programmers\fP for details).  This resource is used in place, and must
not be freed until the AsciiText widget is destroyed.  There is no
type converter registered for this resource, so it may not be set from
the resource manager. 
.IP sensitive 1.5i
Whether or not the toolkit will pass events to this widget.  The
widget will not get events if either \fBancestorSensitive\fP or 
\fBsensitive\fP is \fBFalse\fP.
.IP string 1.5i
If the AsciiText widget is of type \fBXawAsciiString\fP then this string
contains the buffer to be displayed in the AsciiText widget. 
If the AsciiText widget is of type \fBXawAsciiFile\fP then the
string contains the name of the file to be displayed.  This string is
normally copied by the text widget into internal memory, but
may be used in place by setting the \fBuseStringInPlace\fP resource.
As of X11R4 this is a settable resource.  This is an
AsciiSource resource.
.IP textSink 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP textSource 1.5i
The widget pointer to the TextSink or TextSource object that this widget is
currently using.  The AsciiText widget initializes these resources to point
to an AsciiSink and AsciiSource respectively.
.IP translations 1.5i
The event bindings associated with this widget.
.IP type 1.5i
This resource may be either \fBXawAsciiString\fP or
\fBXawAsciiFile\fP.  The value of this resource determines whether the
\fBstring\fP contains the name of a file to be opened or a buffer to
be displayed by the text widget.  A converter has been registered for
this resource and accepts the values \fBstring\fP and \fBfile\fP.
This is an AsciiSource resource.
.IP useStringInPlace 1.5i
While having the AsciiText widget perform dynamic memory management
makes the programmer's job much easier, and is very helpful for most
tasks, there are times when it just gets in the way.  For these cases,
setting this resource to \fBTrue\fP will force the AsciiText widget to
use the \fBstring\fP in place.  Be sure to set the \fBtype\fP resource
to the size of the buffer allocated by the application.  If the
\fBstring\fP is used in place then it must exist for the lifetime of the
text widget, or until it has been reset.  This is an AsciiSource
resource.
.IP wrap 1.5i
When the text in any one line is wider than the window there are several
possible actions.  This resource allows the user to decide what will
happen.  The accepted values for this resource are
\fBXawtextWrapNever\fP, \fBXawtextWrapLine\fP, and
\fBXawtextWrapWord\fP.  With \fBXawtextWrapLine\fP is enabled all text
that is too long to fit on a line will be dropped onto the next line.
The break will occur at the window edge.  With \fBXawtextWrapWord\fP the
same action occurs but the text is broken at a word boundary if at all
possible.  If no wrapping is enabled then the text will just extend off
the edge of the window, and a small rectangle will be painted in the
right margin to alert the user to the fact that the line is too long.  A
type converter is registered that accepts \fBnever\fP, \fBword\fP, and
\fBline\fP as good values for this resource.
.IP x 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP y 1.5i
The location of the upper lefthand corner of this widget in its parent.
