The Simple widget is not very useful by itself, as it has no semantics
of its own.  It main purpose is to be used as a common superclass for
the other \fIsimple\fP Athena widgets.  This widget adds a cursor and
insensitive border to the resource list provided by the core widget.

.IP accelerators 1.5i
A list of actions to be executed by this widget, even though the
event occurred in another widget.  See section 10.4 in the \fI\*(xT\fP.
.IP ancestorSensitive 1.5i
The sensitivity state of the ancestors of this widget.  A widget is
insensitive if either it or any of its ancestors is insensitive.
This resource should not be changed with \fBXtSetValues\fP.  It may,
however, be queried.
.IP background 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifing the background color of the
widget's window.
.IP backgroundPixmap 1.5i
The background pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of the background color.
.IP borderColor 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifing the border color of the
widget's window.
.IP borderPixmap 1.5i
The border pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of the border color.
.IP borderWidth 1.5i
This is the width of this widget's border.
.IP \fBcallback\fP 1.5i
All routines on this list are called whenever the \fBGripAction\fP
action routine is invoked.  The \fIcall_data\fP contains all
information passed to the action routines.  A more thorough description
is given below in the \fBGrip Actions\fP section.

.br
.ns
.IP width 1.5i
The height and width of this widget in pixels.
.IP \fBinsensitiveBorder\fP 1.5i
This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's border if it becomes insensitive.
.IP mappedWhenManaged 1.5i
If this resource is \fBTrue\fP then the widget's window will automatically be
mapped by the Toolkit when it is realized and managed.
.IP screen 1.5i
The screen that this widget is displayed on.  This is not a settable resource.
.IP sensitive 1.5i
Whether or not the toolkit will pass events to this widget.  The
widget will not get events if either \fBancestorSensitive\fP or 
\fBsensitive\fP is \fBFalse\fP.
