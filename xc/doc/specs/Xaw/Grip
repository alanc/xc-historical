The Grip widget provides a small region in which user input
events (such as ButtonPress or ButtonRelease ) may be handled.
The most common use for the grip is as an attachment point for
visually repositioning an object, such as the pane border in a Paned widget.

.IP accelerators 1.5i
A list of actions to be executed by this widget, even though the
event occurred in another widget.  See section 10.4 in the \fI\*(xT\fP.
.IP ancestorSensitive 1.5i
The sensitivity state of the ancestors of this widget.  A widget is
insensitive if either it or any of its ancestors is insensitive.
This resource should not be changed with \fBXtSetValues\fP.  It may,
however, be queried.
.IP background 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifing the background color of the
widget's window.
.IP backgroundPixmap 1.5i
The background pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of the background color.
.IP borderColor 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifing the border color of the
widget's window.
.IP borderPixmap 1.5i
The border pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of the border color.
.IP borderWidth 1.5i
This is the width of this widget's border.
.IP \fBcallback\fP 1.5i
All routines on this list are called whenever the \fBGripAction\fP
action routine is invoked.  The \fIcall_data\fP contains all
information passed to the action routines.  A more thorough description
is given below in the \fBGrip Actions\fP section.
.IP colormap 1.5i
The colormap that this widget wants for its window.
.IP cursor 1.5i
The cursor that will be displayed as the mouse pointer, whenever the mouse
pointer is in this widget.
.IP depth 1.5i
The depth of this widget's window.
.IP destroyCallback 1.5i
All callback functions on this list are called when this widget is destroyed.
.IP \fBforeground\fP 1.5i
The entire Grip widget is flood filled with this color.
.IP height 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP width 1.5i
The height and width of this widget in pixels.
.IP insensitiveBorder 1.5i
This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's border if it becomes insensitive.
.IP mappedWhenManaged 1.5i
If this resource is \fBTrue\fP then the widget's window will automatically be
mapped by the Toolkit when it is realized and managed.
.IP screen 1.5i
The screen that this widget is displayed on.  This is not a settable resource.
.IP sensitive 1.5i
Whether or not the toolkit will pass events to this widget.  The
widget will not get events if either \fBancestorSensitive\fP or 
\fBsensitive\fP is \fBFalse\fP.
.IP translations 1.5i
The event bindings associated with this widget.
.IP x 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP y 1.5i
The location of the upper lefthand corner of this widget in its parent.

.LP
The Grip widget does not declare any default event translation bindings,
but it does declare a single action routine named \fBGripAction\fP.
The client specifies an arbitrary event translation 
table giving parameters to the \fBGripAction\fP routine. 
.LP
The \fBGripAction\fP action executes the callbacks on the \fBcallback\fP
list, passing as \fIcall_data\fP a pointer to a \fBGripCallData\fP structure, 
defined in the Grip widget's public header file.

In this structure, the \fIevent\fP is a pointer to the input
event that triggered the action, and \fIparams\fP and \fInum_params\fP give
the string parameters specified in the translation table for the
particular event binding.
