The MenuButton widget is an area, often rectangular, that contains a
text label or bitmap image.  When the mouse pointer is on the button,
the button becomes highlighted by drawing a rectangle around its
perimeter.  This highlighting indicates that the button is ready for
selection.  When a mouse button is pressed, the menu button widget will
pop up the menu that has been named in its \fBmenuName\fP resource.

.IP accelerators 1.5i
A list of actions to be executed by this widget, even though the
event occurred in another widget.  See section 10.4 in the \fI\*(xT\fP.
.IP ancestorSensitive 1.5i
The sensitivity state of the ancestors of this widget.  A widget is
insensitive if either it or any of its ancestors is insensitive.
This resource should not be changed with \fBXtSetValues\fP.  It may,
however, be queried.
.IP background 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifying the background color of the
widget's window.
.IP backgroundPixmap 1.5i
The background pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of the background color.
.IP bitmap 1.5i
A bitmap to display instead of a label.  The default size of the
Label will be just large enough to contain the bitmap and the widget's
internal width and height.  The resource converter for this resource
converts a filename into a bitmap.  See \fBConverting Bitmaps\fP for
details on the string to bitmap conversion.  If this bitmap is one bit
deep then the 1's will be rendered in the foreground color, and the
0's in the background color.  Supported is also provided to copy this
pixmap directly into the window with \fBXCopyArea\fP if \fBbitmap\fP
has a depth greater than 1.
.IP borderColor 1.5i
An index into this widget's colormap specifying the border color of the
widget's window.
.IP borderPixmap 1.5i
The border pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of the border color.
.IP borderWidth 1.5i
This is the width of this widget's border.
.IP callback 1.5i
A list of routines to be called when the notify action is invoked.
.IP colormap 1.5i
The colormap that this widget wants for its window.
.IP cornerRoundPercent 1.5i
When a \fBShapeStyle\fP of \fBroundedRectangle\fP is used this
resource controls the radius of the rounded corner.  The radius of the
rounded corners is specified as a percentage of the length of the
shortest side of the widget.  This must be a positive value.
.IP cursor 1.5i
The cursor that will be displayed as the mouse pointer, whenever the mouse
pointer is in this widget.
.IP depth 1.5i
The depth of this widget's window.
.IP destroyCallback 1.5i
All callback functions on this list are called when this widget is destroyed.
.IP font 1.5i
The text font to use when displaying the \fBlabel\fP.
.IP foreground 1.5i
The color to used to draw the \fBlabel\fP.  This color is also used to render
all 1's in the \fBbitmap\fP.
.IP height 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP width 1.5i
The height and width of this widget in pixels.
.IP highlightThickness 1.5i
The thickness of the rectangle that is used to highlight a the button
alerting the user that it is ready to be selected.  The default value is
2 pixels if the \fBshapeStyle\fP is \fBrectangle\fP, and 0 Pixels (no
highlighting) otherwise.
.IP insensitiveBorder 1.5i
This pixmap will be tiled into the widget's border if it becomes insensitive.
.IP internalHeight 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP internalWidth 1.5i
The minimum amount of space to leave between the \fBlabel\fP or \fBbitmap\fP
and the vertical or horizontal edges of the window.
.IP justify 1.5i
Specifies left, center, or right alignment of the label 
within the widget.  This resource may be
specified with the values \fBXtJustifyLeft\fP, \fBXtJustifyCenter\fP,
or \fBXtJustifyRight\fP.  When specifying the justification from a
resource file the values \fBleft\fP, \fBcenter\fP, or \fBright\fP may be
used.
.IP label 1.5i
This is a Latin1 text string to be displayed in the MenuButton's window.
.IP mappedWhenManaged 1.5i
If this resource is \fBTrue\fP then the widget's window will automatically be
mapped by the Toolkit when it is realized and managed.
.IP \fBmenuName\fP 1.5i
Specifies the name of a popup shell to popup as a menu.  The MenuButton
will search for this name using \fBXtNameToWidget\fP starting with itself
as the reference widget.  If it is unsuccessful it will run up the widget
tree using each of its ancestors as the reference widget.  If it is still
unsuccessful it will print a warning message and give up.  Once the
menu is found it will pop it up exclusive and spring_loaded.
.IP resize 1.5i
Specifies whether the MenuButton widget should attempt to resize to its
preferred dimensions whenever its resources are modified with
\fBXtSetValues\fP.  This
attempt at a resize is subject to the dictates of the parent of this
widget which is free to resize the MenuButton reguardless of the state
of this resource. 
.IP shapeStyle 1.5i
Non rectangular buttons may be created using this resource.  Non
rectangular buttons may only be used on a server that supports the
\fBShape Extension\fP.  The MenuButton widget currently supports the following 
shapes: \fBXmuShapeRectangle\fP,
\fBXmuShapeOval\fP, \fBXmuShapeEllipse\fP, and \fBXmuShapeRoundedRectangle\fP.
A resource converter is registered to convert the following string
values to shape styles: \fBrectangle\fP, \fBoval\fP, \fPellipse\fP,
\fBroundedRectangle\fP. 
.IP screen 1.5i
The screen that this widget is displayed on.  This is not a settable resource.
.IP sensitive 1.5i
Whether or not the toolkit will pass events to this widget.  The
widget will not get events if either \fBancestorSensitive\fP or 
\fBsensitive\fP is \fBFalse\fP.
.IP translations 1.5i
The event bindings associated with this widget.
.IP x 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP y 1.5i
The location of the upper left corner of this widget in its parent.

MenuButton Actions
.LP
The full list of actions supported by MenuButton is:
.IP \fBhighlight\fP(\fIcondition\fP) 1.5i
Displays the internal highlight border in the color (\fBforeground\fP
or \fBbackground\fP ) that contrasts with the interior color of the
MenuButton widget.  The conditions \fBWhenUnset\fP or \fBAlways\fP are
understood by this action procedure.  If no argument is passed then
\fBWhenUnset\fP is assumed, maintaining backwards compatibility.
.IP \fBunhighlight\fP(\|) 1.5i
Displays the internal highlight border in the color (\fBXtNforeground\fP
or \fBbackground\fP ) that matches the interior color of the
MenuButton widget.  
.IP \fBset\fP(\|) 1.5i
Enters the \fIset\fP state, in which \fBnotify\fP is possible.  This
action causes the button to display its interior in the
\fBforeground\fP color.  The label or bitmap is displayed in the
\fBbackground\fP color. 
.IP \fBunset\fP(\|) 1.5i
Cancels the \fIset\fP state and displays the interior of the button in the
\fBbackground\fP color.  The label or bitmap is displayed in the
\fBforeground\fP color.
.IP \fBreset\fP(\|) 1.5i
Cancels any \fBset\fP or \fBhighlight\fP and displays the interior of the
button in the \fBbackground\fP color, with the label displayed in the 
\fBforeground\fP color.
.IP \fBnotify\fP(\|) 1.5i
When the button is in the \fBset\fP state this action calls all functions in
the callback list named by the \fBcallback\fP resource.  The value of
the call_data argument in these callback functions is undefined. 
.IP \fBPopupMenu\fP(\|) 1.5i
Pops up the menu specified by the \fBmenuName\fP resource.
