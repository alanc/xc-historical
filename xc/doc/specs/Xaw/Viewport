The Viewport widget consists of a frame window, one or two Scrollbars, and
an inner window.  The frame window is determined by the viewing size of the
data that is to be displayed and the dimensions to which the Viewport is
created.  The inner window is the full size of the data that is to be
displayed and is clipped by the frame window.  The Viewport widget controls
the scrolling of the data directly.  No application callbacks are required
for scrolling.
.LP
When the geometry of the frame window is equal in size to the inner window,
or when the data does not require scrolling, the Viewport widget
automatically removes any scroll bars.  The \fBforceBars\fP option causes
the Viewport widget to display any scroll bar permanently.
.LP
When creating a Viewport widget instance, the following resources are
retrieved from the argument list or the resource database:

.IP accelerators 1.5i
A list of actions to be executed by this widget, even though the
event occurred in another widget.  See section 10.4 in the \fI\*(xT\fP.
.IP ancestorSensitive 1.5i
The sensitivity state of the ancestors of this widget.  A widget is
insensitive if either it or any of its ancestors is insensitive.
This resource is not settable with \fBXtSetValues\fP.  It may
however be queried.
.IP \fBallowHoriz\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBallowVert\fP 1.5i
If these resources are \fBFalse\fP then the Viewport will never create
a scrollbar in this direction.  If it is \fBTrue\fP then the scrollbar will
only appear when it is needed, unless \fBforceBars\fP is \fBTrue\fP.
.IP background 1.5i
The background color of this widget.
.IP backgroundPixmap 1.5i
The background pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of a background color.
.IP borderColor 1.5i
The color of this widget's border.
.IP borderPixmap 1.5i
The border pixmap of this widget.  If this resource is set to
anything other than \fBXtUnspecifiedPixmap\fP the pixmap specified will be
used instead of a background color.
.IP borderWidth 1.5i
This is the width of the border of this widget's window.
.IP children 1.5i
A list of all this composite widget'c current children.  This list contains
many extra children created by the Viewport for internal use.
.IP colormap 1.5i
The colormap that this widget will use to display all of its colors.
.IP depth 1.5i
The depth of this widget's window.
.IP destroyCallback 1.5i
All callback functions on this list are called when this widget is destroyed.
.IP \fBforceBars\fP 1.5i
When \fBTrue\fP the scrollbars that have been \fIallowed\fP will always be
visable on the screen.  If \fBFalse\fP the scrollbars will be visable only
when the inner window is larger than the frame.
.IP height 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP width 1.5i
The height and width of this widget in pixels.
.IP insertPosition 1.5i
[||| What is this resource anyway??? ]
.IP mappedWhenManaged 1.5i
If this resource is \fBTrue\fP then the widget will automatically be
mapped by the Toolkit when it is realized and managed.
.IP numChildren 1.5i
The number of children in this composite widget.  This list contains
many extra children created by the Viewport for internal use.
.IP screen 1.5i
The screen that this widget is displayed on.  This is not a settable resource.
.IP sensitive 1.5i
Whether or not the toolkit will pass events to this widget.  The
widget will not get events if either \fBancestorSensitive\fP or 
\fBsensitive\fP is \fBFalse\fP.
.IP translations 1.5i
The translations associated with this widget.
.IP \fBuseBottom\fP 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP \fBuseRight\fP 1.5i
By default the scrollbars appear on the left and top of the screen.  These
resources allow the vertical scrollbar to be placed on the right edge of
the Vieport, and the horizontal scrollbar on the bottom edge of the Viewport.
.IP x 1.5i
.br
.ns
.IP y 1.5i
The location of the upper lefthand corner of this widget in its parent.

Layout Semantics
.LP
The Viewport widget manages a single child widget.  When the size of the
child is larger than the size of the Viewport, the user can interactively
move the child within the Viewport by repositioning the scrollbars.
.LP
The default size of the Viewport before it is realized is the width and/or
height of the child.  After it is realized, the viewport will allow its
child to grow vertically or horizontally if \fBallowVert\fP or
\fBallowHoriz\fP are set, respectively.  If the corresponding vertical
or horizontal scrolling were not enabled, the viewport will propagate the
geometry request to its own parent and the child will be allowed to change
size only if the Viewport's parent allows it.  Regardless of whether or not
scrolling was enabled in the corresponding direction, if the child requests
a new size smaller than the viewport size, the change will be allowed only
if the parent of the viewport allows the viewport to shrink to the
appropriate dimension.
.LP
The scrollbar children of the viewport are named \fBhorizontal\fP and
\fBvertical\fP.  By using these names the programmer can specify resources
for the individual scrollbars.  \fBXtSetvalues\fP can be used to modify
the resources dynamically once the widget ID has been obtained with
\fBXtNameToWidget\fP.
.NT
Although the Viewport is a Subclass of the Form, no resources for the Form
my be supplied for any of the children of the Viewport.  These constraints
are managed internally, and are not meant for public consumption.
