.IN "Viewport widget" "" "@DEF@"
The Viewport widget consists of a frame window, one or two Scrollbars,
and an inner window.
The frame window is determined by 
the viewing size of the data that is to be displayed 
and the dimensions to which the Viewport is created.
The inner window is the full size of the data that is to be displayed
and is clipped by the frame window.
The Viewport widget controls the scrolling of the data directly.
No application callbacks are required for scrolling.
.LP
When the geometry of the frame window is equal in size to the inner window, 
or when the data does not require scrolling, 
the Viewport widget automatically removes any scroll bars.
The
.PN forceBars 
option causes the Viewport widget to display any scroll bar permanently.
.LP
The class variable for the Viewport widget is
.PN viewportWidgetClass .
.LP
When creating a Viewport widget instance,
the following resources are retrieved from the argument list
or from the resource database:

.LP
The Viewport widget manages a single child widget.
When the size of the child is larger than the size of the Viewport,
the user can interactively move the child within the Viewport
by repositioning the Scrollbars.
.LP
The default size of the Viewport before it is realized is the
width and/or height of the child.
After it is realized, the viewport will allow its
child to grow vertically or horizontally if
.PN XtNallowVert
or
.PN XtNallowHoriz
were set, respectively.  If the corresponding vertical or horizontal
scrolling were not enabled, the viewport will propagate the
geometry request to its own parent and the child will be allowed
to change size only if the (grand) parent allows it.  Regardless
of whether or not scrolling was enabled in the corresponding
direction, if the child requests a new size smaller than the
viewport size, the change will be allowed only if the parent of
the viewport allows the viewport to shrink to the appropriate dimension.
