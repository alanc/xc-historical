 <title>README for XFree86(TM) 3.1
 <author> The XFree86 Project, Inc
 <date>2 October 1994


<abstract>

  XFree86 is a port of X11R6 that supports several versions of Intel-based
Unix and Unix-like operating systems.  This release consists of many new
features and performance improvements as well as many bug fixes.  The
release is available as source patches against the X Consortium X11R6 code,
as well as binary distributions for many architectures.

 </DESCRIP>

The Cirrus and Western Digital accelerators are supported in the SVGA
server; the other chipsets each have their own server.  A list of some
cards which the accelerated servers have been tested is included in the
files AccelCards, Devices, and some of the chipset-specific <tt>README</tt> files.
They may well work on other cards, but we cannot guarantee it.
  
In addition, the following SVGA chipsets are supported:
  <DESCRIP>

	MX68000, MX680010 
    <tag> Video 7/Headland Technologies </tag>
	HT216-32 
</DESCRIP> 

All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes, with
the exception of the Advance Logic, MX and Video 7 chipsets, which are only
supported in 256 color mode.

Refer to the chipset-specific <tt>README</tt> files (currently for Cirrus, Tseng,
Western Digital, ATI, Trident and Video 7) for more information about using
those chipsets.

The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of video
memory in a single bank, the Hercules monochrome card, the Hyundai HGC1280,
Sigma LaserView, Visa and Apollo monochrome cards.  On the Compaq AVGA, only
64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome server, and the GVGA has
not been tested with more than 64k.

The VGA16 server supports memory banking with the ET4000, Trident, ATI,
NCR, OAK and Cirrus 6420 chipsets allowing virtual display sizes up to
about 1600x1200 (with 1MB of video memory).  For other chipsets the display
size is limited to approximately 800x600.


<bf> Note:</bf>
<quote>
      The Diamond SpeedStar 24 (and possibly recent SpeedStar+) boards are
      NOT supported, even though they use the ET4000.  The Stealth 32 which
      uses the ET4000/W32p is also not supported.  Historically the
      information required for this support was only available under
      non-disclosure.  As of September 27, 1994, Diamond has verbally
      agreed to provide The XFree86 Project, Inc. with detailed information
      about Diamond products.  This should permit us to better support
      these in future versions of XFree86.

<sect><heading><label id="Changes">Important Changes</>
<p>

  There are a number of important user-visible changes between
XFree86 2.1.1 and XFree86 3.1.  The first is the default install location.
The XFree86 distribution is now installed by default under <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt>
instead of <tt>/usr/X386</tt>.  
This moves away from the now out-dated "X386" name,
and it also makes it possible for both versions to co-exist.

The next major change is related to the server configuration file.  
The old <tt>Xconfig</tt> file has been replaced in XFree86 3.1 by an 
<tt>XF86Config</tt> file.
This is more than just a name change.  
The new <tt>XF86Config</tt> file uses a format that is quite different
from the old <tt>Xconfig</tt> file.   
The new format is more structured, logical, and extendable than the
old format.  
We realise that the transition to this new format won't be without
problems.  
To help in 
this transition we have provided a program (`reconfig') to convert the old
<tt>Xconfig</tt> format into the new <tt>XF86Config</tt> format.  
This doesn't provide a
perfect conversion mostly because the new format contains more information
than the old format.  Some manual editing will always be required.  One of
the new types of information the <tt>XF86Config</tt> contains is a description of
the monitor(s) you are using.  This addition allows the servers to check
that the video modes are within the specifications of the monitor.

For information about the new config file format and how to use it, refer
to the <em>XF86Config(4/5)</em> and  <em>reconfig(1)</em> manual
pages, and the <tt>README.Config</tt> file which can be found in
<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc</tt>. 

Another change related to the config file is the locations the servers look
for it in.  In previous releases the servers would look in places which
could be specified by the user.  This raised a number of security concerns.
To address these, the server now only looks in places which are normally
under the control of the system administrator.  For further details, refer
to the <em>XFree86(1)</em> manual page.



<sect> Where to get more information
<p>

Additional documentation is available in the <em>XFree86(1)</em>,
<em>XF86Config(4/5)</em>, <em>XF86_SVGA(1)</em>,
<em>XF86_Mono(1)</em>, <em>XF86_VGA16(1)</em> and
<em>XF86_Accel(1)</em> manual pages. 
In addition, several <tt>README</tt> files and tutorial documents are provided.
These are available in <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc</tt> in the binary
distributions, and in  <tt>xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/doc</tt> in
the source distribution. 

The files <tt>README.Config</tt> and <tt>VideoModes.doc</tt> should be
consulted for 
information on how to set up the XFree86 servers.  All supplied
documents and manual pages should be read before contacting the
XFree86 team for assistance.

Documentation on SVGA driver development can be found in the directory
<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/Server/VGADriverDoc</tt> in the binary
distribution, and in the directory
<tt>xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/VGADriverDoc</tt> in the source
distribution.  

If you are totally at a loss, you can contact the XFree86 Core Team at
the electronic mail address below.

There is a Usenet news group comp.windows.x.i386unix that contains
mostly discussions about XFree86 and related topics. Many questions can
be answered there. The answers to common questions are found in the
corresponding FAQ.

The first of these was the primary motivation.  We have held discussions
with the X Consortium on and off for many months, attempting to find an
avenue by which our loosely-organized free software project could be
given a voice within the X Consortium.  The bylaws of the Consortium
would not recognize such an organization.  After an initial investigation
about funding, we decided to form our own corporation to provide the
avenue we needed to meet the requirements of the X Consortium bylaws.

By doing this, we were able to be involved in the beta-test interval for
X11R6, and have contributed the majority of XFree86 to the X11R6 core
release.  The version of XFree86 in the X11R6 core is 3.0.  As time goes
on, XFree86 will be involved with more of the development of The X Window
System, as a full Consortium member.  How exactly this will evolve is still
being determined.

An additional benefit of this incorporation is that The XFree86 Project,
Inc has obtained outside financial support for our work.  This will
hopefully give us the freedom to be more proactive in obtaining new
video hardware, and enable us to release better products more quickly,
as we will be able to go and get what we need, and get it into the hands
of the people who can do the work.

The initial Board of Directors and Officers of the The XFree86 Project,
Inc, are:
<itemize>
       <item> David Dawes, Secretary
       <item> Dirk Hohndel, Vice-President
       <item> Glenn Lai, Director
       <item> Rich Murphey, Treasurer
       <item> Jim Tsillas, Director
       <item> Jon Tombs, Director
       <item> David Wexelblat, President
</itemize>
Email to <it>&lt;BOD@XFree86.org&gt;</it> reaches the board of directors. 
       
Our bylaws have been crafted in such a way to ensure that XFree86 is and
always will be a free software project.  There is no personal financial
benefit to any member of the Core Team or any other XFree86 participant.
All assets of the corporation remain with the corporation, and, in the
event of the dissolution of the corporation, all assets will be turned over
to the X Consortium, Inc.  It is hoped that by doing this, our corporation
will be merely a formalization of what we have been doing in the past,
rather than something entirely new.

Here is a list of the organizations and individuals who have provided
sponsorship to The XFree86 Project, Inc, either by financial contribution
or by the donation of equipment and resources.  The XFree86 Project, Inc
gratefully acknowledges these contributions, and hopes that we can do
justice to them by continuing to release high-quality free software for
the betterment of the Internet community as a whole.

UUNET Communications Services, Inc, deserves special mention.  This
organization stepped forward and contributed the entire 1994 X Consortium
membership fee on a moment's notice.  This single act ensured XFree86's
involvement in X11R6.
