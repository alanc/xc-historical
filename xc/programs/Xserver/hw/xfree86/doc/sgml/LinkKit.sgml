<!-- This was item 0. Sorry. -->
<item> For systems which don't use gcc-2, you may need to install libgcc.a if
   the binary distribution you are using was built with gcc-2.

<item> Edit the site.def file to define which servers you want to build, and
   the drivers you want included.

    <itemize>
    <item> Set <tt>HasGcc</tt> and <tt>HasGcc2</tt> to match the compiler
      you are using if the defaults aren't correct.
    <item> If the LinkKit was built with gcc-2.x and you are using some other
      compiler, you must install libgcc.a and set <tt>NeedLibGcc</tt> to
      <tt>YES</tt>.

    <item> Set <tt>XF86SvgaDrivers</tt> to the list of drivers you want to
	include in the SVGA server.
    <item> Set <tt>XF86Vga16Drivers</tt> to the list of drivers you want to
	include in the 16 colour server.
    <item> Set <tt>XF86Vga2Drivers</tt> to the list of drivers you want to
	include in the monochrome vga server.
    <item> Set<tt> XF86MonoDrivers</tt> to the list of non-vga mono drivers
	you want to include in the mono or VGA16 servers (when building
	dual-headed servers).
    </itemize>
   Note: the ordering of drivers determines the order in which the probing
   is done.  The `<tt>generic</tt>' driver should be the last one included in
   the Mono and VGA16 and SVGA servers because its probe always succeeds.
   The <!-- ??? -->
<item> If you are including a driver that it not part of the standard
   distribution, make a directory in <tt>drivers/vga256</tt>
   (<tt>drivers/vga2</tt> if it is for the VGA2 part of the Mono server,
    <tt>drivers/vga16</tt> if it is for the 16
   colour server, or <tt>drivers/mono</tt> non-VGA part of the Mono and VGA16
   servers) and copy either the source or .o file and a suitable Imakefile
   into that directory.  The name of the directory should be the same as the
   name of the driver (refer to the documentation in the <tt>VGADriverDoc</tt>
   directory for more details).

<item> To build the Makefile, run
<verb>
  ./mkmf
</verb>
<item> Run `<tt>make</tt>' to link the server(s) as configured.

<item> Run `<tt>make install</tt>' to install the new server(s).

<item> Run `<tt>make clean</tt>' to remove the files that were created by this
   procedure.

<item> It is possible to see which drivers are included in the server by
   running it with the `<tt>-showconfig</tt>' flag.
