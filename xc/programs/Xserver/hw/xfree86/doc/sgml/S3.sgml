<sect> Supported hardware
<p>
The current S3 Server supports all available S3 chipsets: 911, 924,
801/805, 928, 864, and 964. Nevertheless, this is not enough to
support every board using one of these chipsets. The following list
contains some data points on boards that are known to work. If your
card is similar to one of the described ones, chances are good it
might work for you, too.

        Note: the AT&amp;T20C490 RAMDAC is not automatically detected by
        the server.  You need to provide a `<tt/Ramdac "att20c490"/'
        entry in your <tt/XF86Config/.

	Real AT&amp;T 20C490 or 20C491 RAMDACs work with the
        <tt/"dac_8_bit"/ option.  Some clones (like the Winbond
        82C490) do not.

 	Note: the AT&amp;T20C490 RAMDAC is not automatically detected by
	the server.  You need to provide a `<tt/Ramdac "att20c490"/'
	entry in your XF86Config.  Also, the server's RAMDAC probe
	reportedly causes problems with some of these boards, and a
	RamDac entry should be used to avoid the probe.

 	Real AT&amp;T 20C490 or 20C491 RAMDACs work with the
 	<tt/"dac_8_bit"/ option.  Some clones (like the Winbond
 	82C490) do not.

 	8, 15/16 and 24(32) bpp

 	Supports 8bit/pixel RGB in 8bpp and gamma correction for 15/16
 	and 24bpp modes

 	24 bpp might get ``snowy'' if the clock is near the limit of
 	30MHz. This is not considered dangerous, but limits the
 	usability of 24 bpp.

 	D-step (or below) chips cannot be used with a line width of
 	1152; hence the most effective mode for a 1 MB board is about
 	1088x800x8 (similiar to 2 MB, 1088x800x16).

        Mirage P64 with BIOS 4.xx uses the S3 SDAC.

 	There are some known problems with the GXE64 Pro support,
 	including some image shifting/wrapping at 15/16/24 bpp.

 	We have found that &num;9 no longer support the GXE64 Pro
 	at 1600x1200.  They do however have a new (and more expensive)
 	board called the GXE64Pro-1600 which uses a 220MHz RAMDAC
 	instead of 135MHz part used on the other boards.  It is not
 	known at this stage whether the GXE64Pro-1600 will work with
 	XFree86 3.1.

<sect> 16bpp and 32bpp
<p>

On 801/805 + AT&amp;T490 Cards (like the Farenheit 1280+ VLB) only 15 and
16bpp are supported. 32bpp isn't available on this type of
chips. (There is a 24 bit mode under MS Windows, but it's not a 32bpp
sparse mode but a real 3 bytes/pixel mode -- implementing this in
XFree86 isn't easy).

<sect> Additional Notes
<p>
If you have a RAMDAC that is not listed here, be VERY careful not to
overdrive it using XF86_S3. Better contact the XFree86 team first to
verify that running XF86_S3 will not damage your board.

If you feel adventerous you could also open up your computer and have
a peek at your RAMDAC. The RAMDAC is usually ome the larger chips
(second or third largest chip that is NOT an EPROM) on the board.  The
markings on it are usually

<tscreen><verb>
  <Company logo>

      <company identifier><part number>-<speed grade>
      <manufacturing week><manufacturing year>  
      <lot number><other funny numbers>
</verb></tscreen>

For example:

<tscreen><verb>
          @@
          @@ AT&amp;T

        ATT20C490-11
         9339S ES
          9869874
</verb></tscreen>

This is a AT&amp;T 490 with a speed grade of 110 MHz. This would then mean
that you put a `<tt/DacSpeed 110/' line in your <tt/XF86Config/ file.  Be
advised that some RAMDACs have different modes that have different
limits. The manufacturer will always mark the chip naming the higher
limits, so you should be careful.  The S3 server knows how to handle
the limits for most of the RAMDACs it supports providing the DacSpeed
is specified correctly.


chips labeled <bf/-80/ or <bf/-8/  should use `<tt/DacSpeed 80/' in
the device section
<tscreen><verb>
S3716-ME SDAC  ==>  DacSpeed 110
SC15025-8      ==>  DacSpeed  80
ATT20C490-80   ==>  DacSpeed  80
</verb></tscreen>

Some RAMDACs (like the Ti3025) require some mode timing consideration
for their hardware cursor to work correctly.  The Ti3025 requires that
the mode have a back porch of at least 80 pixel-clock cycles.  A
symptom of this not being correct is the HW cursor being chopped off
when positioned close to the right edge of the screen.
