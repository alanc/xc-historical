/*
 * CHIPSProbe --

 * This is the function that makes a yes/no decision about whether or not
 * a chipset supported by this driver is present or not.    The server will
 * call each driver's probe function in sequence, until one returns TRUE
 * or they all fail.
 *
 * Pretty much any mechanism can be used to determine the presence of the
 * chipset.  If there is a BIOS signature (e.g. ATI, GVGA), it can be read
 * via /dev/mem on most OSs, but some OSs (e.g. Mach) require special
 * handling, and others (e.g. Amoeba) don't allow reading    the BIOS at
 * all.  Hence, this mechanism is discouraged, if other mechanisms can be
 * found.    If the BIOS-reading mechanism must be used, examine the ATI and
 * GVGA drivers for the special code that is needed.    Note that the BIOS 
 * base should not be assumed to be at 0xC0000 (although most are).  Use
 * 'vga256InfoRec.BIOSbase', which will pick up any changes the user may
 * have specified in the Xconfig file.
 *
 * The preferred mechanism for doing this is via register identification.
 * It is important not only the chipset is detected, but also to
 * ensure that other chipsets will not be falsely detected by the probe
 * (this is difficult, but something that the developer should strive for).  
 * For testing registers, there are a set of utility functions in the 
 * "compiler.h" header file.    A good place to find example probing code is
 * in the SuperProbe program, which uses algorithms from the "vgadoc2.zip"
 * package (available on most PC/vga FTP mirror sites, like ftp.uu.net and
 * wuarchive.wustl.edu).
 *
 * Once the chipset has been successfully detected, then the developer needs 
 * to do some other work to find memory, and clocks, etc, and do any other
 * driver-level data-structure initialization may need to be done.

     * The calculation for Base works as follows:

     *
     * This number is divided by 8 for the monochrome server, because
     * there are 8 pixels per byte.
     *
     * For the color server, it's a bit more complex.    There is 1 pixel
     * per byte.    In general, the 256-color modes are in word-mode 
     * (16-bit words).  Word-mode vs byte-mode is will vary based on
     * the chipset - refer to the chipset databook.  So the pixel address 
     * must be divided by 2 to get a word address.  In 256-color modes, 
     * the 4 planes are interleaved (i.e. pixels 0,3,7, etc are adjacent 
     * on plane 0). The starting address needs to be as an offset into 
     * plane 0, so the Base address is divided by 4.
     *
     * So:
     *      Monochrome: Base is divided by 8
     *      Color:
     *  if in word mode, Base is divided by 8
     *  if in byte mode, Base is divided by 4
     *
     * The generic VGA only supports 16 bits for the Starting Address.
     * But this is not enough for the extended memory.  SVGA chipsets
     * will have additional bits in their extended registers, which
     * must also be set.
