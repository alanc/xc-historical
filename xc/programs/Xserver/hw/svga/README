The idea behind the cfb patches is avoid any routine that only works
with a signle clipping rectangle at gc-validate time. svgaBank.c 
happyly modifies pCompositeClip without validation ... In the case
of lines and points, the fast one-rect rouitne is called, but there is
a check at the top of the routine, whether there was really only
one clipping rectangle. I know this is a hack, but it works and
is reasonable fast for such a dead architecture.


The server is simply started with:

	Xsvga -config <pmifile>:<mode>


I have included a pmi file for a S3 chip using 640x480. Here the command
line would be:

	Xsvga -config vga.pmi:640x480


To learn more about the pmi file, look at the VESA SVPMI standard 
document (VS911020).
