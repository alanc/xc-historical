	Sun X11 Beta-2 drivers -  23 July 1987

A joint production of:

	Adam de Boor		University of California,  Berkeley

	David Rosenthal &
	Stuart Marks &
	Robin Schaufler &
	Mike Schwartz		Sun Microsystems

This version of the Sun X.11 drivers uses ../mi,  ../mfb and ../cfb to support
the following configurations:

	Sun/2		bw2	cg2/3/5
	Sun/3		bw2	cg2/3/4/5
	Sun/4		bw2

The following configurations are NOT supported:

	Sun/1		bw1	cg1	(requires separate port)
	Sun/2			gp	(use /dev/cgtwo0)
	Sun/3			gp	(use /dev/cgtwo0)
	Sun/4			cg2	(we're working on it)

The drivers are completely untuned, and have inferior performance.  The code
is lint-free.  It installs and runs on these configurations under SunOS 3.2
and 3.4.  However, we must stress that it is completely unsupported, and if
you have problems installing or using it you are on your own.

Things to check before building:

1)	server/include/site.h - replace the font path.

2)	Make sure the fonts/Makefile uses the pad flag on the font
	compiler to pad the glyphs to 4-byte boundaries.

3)	Change the server makefile to build Xsun

4)	Change the server/ddx makefile to build the subdirectories:

	mfb mi sun

5)	If you want the non-portable zoids extension, add -DZOIDS to CFLAGS.
	The non-portable zoids have worse performance than portable zoids
	but prove that the extension mechanism works for output.

all: Xsun


Then build the system by:

1)	Make the dependency generator:

	cd makedepend ; make ; cd ..

2)	Update the dependencies by:

	find . -name Makefile -exec chmod u+w {} \;
	make depend
	find . -name Makefile -exec chmod u-w {} \;

3)	Go for it.  In the top-level directory, type

	    make

	This takes about forty minutes on a 4/260, and somewhat longer
	on other Suns.

4)	Exit suntools or whatever other window system you use.

5)	On the console, or from an rlogin connection,  start the server:

	server/Xsun
	
	If its from the console,  you probably want to redirect the
	output thus:

	server/Xsun >& /tmp/x11.out

6)	From an rlogin connection,  start an xterm by:

	setenv DISPLAY unix:0
	clients/xterm/xterm &

7)	In general,  Xsun auto-configures to use all the available
	framebuffers.  In some circumstances,  you may need to use a
	-dev argument on the command line to prevent this:

	3/110	If you want to use color,  use -dev /dev/cgfour0.  If
		you want to use monochrome -dev /dev/bwtwo0.
		
	GP	If you have a GP installed,  use -dev /dev/cgtwo0.

8)	To shut the server down,  hit  it with a Hangup or Terminate signal.

9)	Xsun coexists with the SunWindows environment.  If you run Xsun
	from a shell window under suntools, then Xsun will overlay that
	desktop.  If you have two desktops, then 'adjacentscreens' will still
	be in effect.  You may want to redirect the output of the server to a
	window that is visible on another desktop.
