There are several code fragments that need to be placed in the device
dependent part of the server.  These are described below.  These code
fragments are device and implementation dependent.

This code fragment should go at the front of the file that handles
keyboards:

#ifdef XTESTEXT1
/*
 * defined in xtestext1di.c
 */
extern int	on_steal_input;
extern Bool	XTestStealKeyData();
#endif XTESTEXT1

This code fragment should go in the function that parses input from the
keyboard or pointer after you know what input action has occurred, but before
you have told the server about it.  If conditionalizes the actual function
call to pass the information on:

#ifdef XTESTEXT1
	if (!on_steal_input ||
	    XTestStealKeyData(code, direction, dev_type, x, y))
#endif /* XTESTEXT1 */
	handle_device_event(...);

This code fragment should go in the function that handles mouse motion after
you have figured out how much the mouse has moved:

#ifdef XTESTEXT1
	if (on_steal_input)
	    XTestStealMotionData(dx, dy, dev, x, y);
#endif XTESTEXT1


This code fragment should go at the front of the os-specific code where
you wait (by doing a select on the socket in our implementation) for
something to happen:

#ifdef	XTESTEXT1
extern int	playback_on;
void XTestComputeWaitTime();
#endif  XTESTEXT1

These code fragments should go in the os-specific code on both sides of
where you wait (by doing a select on the socket in our implementation)
for something to happen:

#ifdef XTESTEXT1
	    if (playback_on)
		    XTestComputeWaitTime(wt = &waittime);
#endif XTESTEXT1
	    ... code to do select ...
	    WakeupHandler(i, LastSelectMask);
#ifdef XTESTEXT1
	    if (playback_on)
		    i = XTestProcessInputAction(i, &waittime);
#endif XTESTEXT1
