.TH XMAG 1 "28 January 1991" "X Version 11"
.SH NAME
xmag \- magnify parts of the screen.

.SH SYNOPSIS
xmag [-mag magfactor] [-source geom] [-toolkitoption ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The xmag program allows you to magnify portions of the screen.  If no 
explicit region is specified, a square with the pointer in the upper left 
corner is displayed indicating the area to be enlarged.  The area can be 
draged out to the desired size by pressing Button 2.  Once a region has 
been selected, a window is popped up showing a blown up version of the region 
in which each pixel in the source image is represented by a small square of 
the same color.  Pressing Button1 on the pointer in the enlargement window 
shows a small pixel information window displaying the position and RGB value
of the pixel under the pointer until the button is released.  Pressing ``Q'' 
or ``^C'' in the enlargement window exits the program.  The application has
3 buttons across its top.  Close deletes this particular magnification 
instance.  Replace brings up the rubber band selector again to select another
region for this magnification instance.  New brings up the rubber band
selector to create a new magnification instance.  Note that resizeing xmag
resizes the magnification area.  Xmag also preserves colormaps, visuals, and
window depth from the target magnification area.
