			Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here


This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.  It was one of
the first "serious" programs ported, and still has a lot of historical baggage.
Ideally, there would be a general tty widget and then vt102 and tek4014 
subwidgets so that they could be used in other programs.  We are trying to 
clean things up as we go, but there is still a lot of work to do.

If you are porting this to a machine that has problems with overlapping
bcopy's, watch out!

The Xterm Control Sequences document still needs to be written.  The X10
version may be a good place to start, but will need to be updated.
