The version of Fresco included here is obsolete.  Do not try to build
this version of Fresco.

Fresco has moved to a standalone distribution model decoupled from X11 
releases to provide more flexibility in how, when, and to whom releases 
are made available.

The latest Fresco sources and documentation are available at:
