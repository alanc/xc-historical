DESCRIPTION:
    [detailed description of problem.  If this is a request for an
     enhancement, justify it.]

REPEAT BY:
    [What you did to get the error; include test program or session
     transcript if at all possible.  Be specific; if we can't
     reproduce it, we can't fix it.  Bug reports without a clear,
     deterministic way of reproducing them will be fixed only after
     all bug reports that do.]

SAMPLE FIX:
    [preferred, but not necessary.  Please send context diffs (diff -c).
     Be sure to include our "$XConsortium" ident line in any diffs.  The
     best way to do this is to add your own versioning line immediately
     after ours.]

[PLEASE make your Subject: line as descriptive as possible.
 Subjects like "xterm bug" or "bug report" are not helpful!]
[Remove all the explanatory text in brackets before mailing.]
