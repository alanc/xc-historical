>>TITLE XSetFunction CH05
void
XSetFunction(display, gc, functn)
Display *display= Dsp;
GC gc;
int functn = GXset;
>>SET need-gc-flush
>>ASSERTION Good A
The xname function sets the
.M function 
component of the specified GC to the value of the
.A function
argument.
>>STRATEGY
Create window.
Create GC with bg = BlackPixel, fg = WhitePixel, fn = GXcopy.
Set pixel at (0, 0) to WhitePixel with XDrawPoint.
Verify pixel at (0, 0) is WhitePixel with XGetImage and XGetPixel.
Set fg to (BlackPixel xor WhitePixel)
Set fn component of GC to GXxor with XSetFunction.
Set pixel at (0, 0) to  fg with XDrawPoint.
Verify pixel at (0, 0) is BlackPixel with XGetImage and XGetPixel.
>>CODE
XVisualInfo *vp;
