>>ASSERTION Good A
When a client sends a valid xname protocol request to the X server,
then the X server sends back a reply to the client with the minimum
required length.
>>STRATEGY
Call library function testfunc() to do the following:
Open a connection to the X server using native byte sex.
Send a valid xname protocol request to the X server.
Verify that the X server sends back a reply and a DeviceMappingNotify event.
Open a connection to the X server using reversed byte sex.
Send a valid xname protocol request to the X server.
Verify that the X server sends back a reply and a DeviceMappingNotify event.
>>CODE

	test_type = GOOD;

	/* Call a library function to exercise the test code */
	testfunc(tester);

>>ASSERTION Bad A
When a client sends an invalid xname protocol request to the X server,
in which the length field of the request is not the minimum length required to 
contain the request
plus zero or more keycode groups,
then the X server sends back a BadLength error to the client.
>>STRATEGY
Call library function testfunc() to do the following:
Open a connection to the X server using native byte sex.
Send an invalid xname protocol request to the X server with length 
  one less than the minimum length required to contain the request + zero keycode groups.
Verify that the X server sends back a BadLength error.
Open a connection to the X server using reversed byte sex.
Send an invalid xname protocol request to the X server with length 
  one less than the minimum length required to contain the request + zero keycode groups.
Verify that the X server sends back a BadLength error.

Open a connection to the X server using native byte sex.
Send an invalid xname protocol request to the X server with length 
  one greater than the minimum length required to contain the request + n keycode groups.
Verify that the X server sends back a BadLength error.
Open a connection to the X server using reversed byte sex.
Send an invalid xname protocol request to the X server with length 
  one greater than the minimum length required to contain the request + n keycode groups.
Verify that the X server sends back a BadLength error.
>>CODE

	test_type = BAD_LENGTH; /* < minimum */

	/* Call a library function to exercise the test code */
	testfunc(tester);

	test_type = JUST_TOO_LONG; /* > minimum + n keycode groups */

>>ASSERTION Bad A
When a client sends an invalid xname protocol request to the X server,
in which the length field of the request exceeds the maximum length accepted
by the X server,
then the X server sends back a BadLength error to the client.
>>STRATEGY
Call library function testfunc() to do the following:
Open a connection to the X server using native byte sex.
Send an invalid xname protocol request to the X server with length 
  one greater than the maximum length accepted by the server.
