>>ASSERTION Good A
A call to xname returns the bounding box of the specified 8-bit
character string,
.A string ,
as rendered in the font referenced by
.A font_struct .
>>STRATEGY
The known good font information structures are used so that these tests
are isolated from XLoadQueryFont.
Make a string consisting of all characters from 0 to 255
Call XTextExtents.
Verify by direct calculation from the metrics.

>>ASSERTION def
The
.M ascent
field of
.A overall
is set to the maximum of the ascent metrics 
of all characters in the string.
>>ASSERTION def
The
.M descent
field of
.A overall
is set to the maximum of the descent metrics
of all characters in the string.
>>ASSERTION def
The
.M width
field of
.A overall
is set to the sum of the character-width metrics 
of all characters in the string.
>>ASSERTION def
The
.M lbearing
field of
.A overall
is set to the minimum L of all characters in the string, where for each
character L is the left-side-metric plus the sum of the character
widths of all preceding characters in the string.
>>ASSERTION def
The
.M rbearing
field of
.A overall
is set to the maximum R of all characters in the string, where for each
character R is the right-side-bearing metric plus the sum of the
character widths of all preceding characters in the string.
>>ASSERTION def
The font_ascent_return argument is set to the logical ascent of the font,
the font_descent_return argument is set to the logical descent of the font and
the direction_return argument is set to either FontLeftToRight
or FontRightToLeft.
>>ASSERTION def
When the font has no defined default character, then
undefined characters in the string are taken to have all zero metrics.
>>ASSERTION def
Characters with all zero metrics are ignored.
>>ASSERTION def
When the font has no defined
.M default_char ,
then the undefined characters in the string are also ignored.
