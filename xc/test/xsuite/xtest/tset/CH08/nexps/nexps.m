>>TITLE NoExpose CH08
>>ASSERTION Good A
There are no assertions in sections 8.1-8.4 for xname events.
There are already assertions for
.F XCopyArea
and
.F XCopyPlane
covering xname events.
>>STRATEGY
Put out a message explaining that there are no specific assertions for
xname events in sections 8.1-8.4, and that delivery of xname events is
covered in XCopyPlane and XCopyArea.
>>CODE

	report("There are no specific assertions for %s events in sections 8.1-8.4.", TestName);
	report("Delivery of %s events is covered in XCopyPlane and XCopyArea.", TestName);
	tet_result(TET_NOTINUSE);
