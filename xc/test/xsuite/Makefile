#
# Makefile for building the TET and the X test suite libraries/utilities.
#
# For full details on what needs to be built and how to build, refer
# to the User Guide in file userguide.mm in the directory xtest/doc.
# This Makefile just performs some of the required steps more easily.
#
# First, work through the instructions in the section entitled 
# "Configuring the X test suite" in the User Guide. This involves 
# setting the configuration parameters correctly for your system.
# This also includes setting the TET_ROOT environment variable to the 
# directory in which this Makefile is supplied.
#
# Ensure your PATH environment variable is set to include $TET_ROOT/xtest/bin.
#
# You may then need to build the portability library, if your system is not 
# a POSIX.1 system. This is described further in the User Guide.
#
# Then, you can perform the following steps described in the User Guide
# by just typing "make" in this directory:
#
# Building the TET:
# 1. The Test Case Controller (TCC)
# 2. The API library
#
# Building the X test suite libraries and utilities:
# 1. Building the X test suite library
# 2. Building the X Protocol library
# 3. Building the X test fonts library
# 4. Building the mc utility
# 5. Building the blowup utility
#
# You then need to build and install the test fonts as described in the 
# User Guide.
