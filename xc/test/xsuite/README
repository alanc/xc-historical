This file describes the software in release 1.2 of the
Xlib and X protocol test suite from the X Consortium.

The test suite includes tests for sections 2 to 10 of the X11R4 Xlib 
specifications. 

The test suite also contains touch tests for the X Protocol (version 11).

The main directories to be aware of initially are:

tet - This contains the source files and include files needed to build 
the Test Environment Toolkit (TET).

xtest - This contains the tests included in the X test suite
which are stored as a complete TET test suite. This includes all
necessary configuration files and scenario files to enable you to use
the X test suite following the instructions in the documentation.

xtest/doc - This contains the documentation. It contains a user guide,
programmers guide and release notes. These are supplied in troff(1)
format requiring the mm macro package, and also in PostScript format.
You should look at the release notes and the user guide before
attempting to install and build the test suite.
