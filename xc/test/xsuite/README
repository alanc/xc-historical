This file describes the software in release 1.1 of the
revised X test suite produced for MIT by UniSoft Group Limited.

The test suite includes tests for sections 2 to 10 of the X11R4 Xlib 
specifications. 

The test suite also contains touch tests for the X Protocol (version 11).

The main directories to be aware of initially are:

tet - This contains the source files and include files needed to build 
the Test Environment Toolkit (TET).

xtest - This contains the tests included in the revised X test suite
which are stored as a complete TET test suite. This includes all
necessary configuration files and scenario files to enable you to use
the X test suite following the instructions in the documentation.

xtest/doc - This contains the documentation. It contains a user guide,
programmers guide and release notes. These are supplied in troff(1)
format requiring the mm macro package, and also in PostScript format.
It also contains a template for error reports and a description of how
to submit them. You should look at the release notes and the user guide
before attempting to install and build the test suite.
