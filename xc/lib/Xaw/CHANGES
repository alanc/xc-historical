The following changes have been made to this directory since R2:

     o	the Athena widgets now use the R3 Intrinsics.
     o	many resources that the documentation said were ints are
	really Dimensions and/or Positions.  See Xt/CHANGES for
	the impact of this.
     o	the header file Misc.h has been renamed to XawMisc.h.
     o	Scrollbar does color and reverse video properly.  SetValues on
	an unrealized Scrollbar now works better.
     o	AsciiSink (used by AsciiDisk and AsciiString) has been
	fixed to not do a bad left-bearing computation and to get
	the correct foreground.
     o	Text, AsciiString, and AsciiDisk now get the correct background
	resource.
     o	Several key bindings in Text that were broken now work.
     o	Clock now handles exposures without causing its interval timer to
	close to zero.
     o	Load now uses resource XtNhighlight to specify the label and scale
	color.  It also updates more intelligently and scales correctly.
     o	Extra spaces in Text have been removed to make it work on compilers
	with small internal table space.
     o	Grip has a cursor resource.
     o	the Mailbox widget has a new resource to specify a shell
	command to be executed to check for new mail.  It also now
	uses the translation manager and no longer compresses its
	interval timer to zero on exposures or button presses.
     o	VPaned no longer assumes all it's children are
	mapped_when_managed.  It no longer grabs the mouse when
	resizing a pane.
     o	a new routine, XtSimpleStippledPixmap, has been added.
	(documentation not yet written).
     o	a new widget, List, has been added.
