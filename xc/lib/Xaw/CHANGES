The following changes have been made to this directory since R2:

     o  the Athena widgets now use the R3 Intrinsics.

     o  Scrollbar does color and reverse video properly.

     o  AsciiSink has been fixed to not do a bad left-bearing computation.

     o  Clock now handles exposures without causing its interval timer to
	close to zero.

     o  Load now uses resource XtNhighlight to specify the label and scale
	color.

     o  Extra spaces in Text have been removed to make it work on compilers
	with small internal table space.
