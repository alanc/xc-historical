.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \*f to determine the following information for a \s-2PICK\s+2 input
device associated with a given workstation type:
.RS
.sp .3
\(bu   Number and list of available prompt/echo types
.sp .2
\(bu   Default echo area
.sp .2
\(bu   Default input data record
.sp .2
\(bu   Default path order
.RE
.LP
Since the default prompt/echo type for all input devices is 1, the default
input data record is for that prompt/echo type.  There are no default input
data records for prompt/echo types other than 1.
.SS C Input Parameters
.LP
Applications using the \s-2C\s+2 binding must create a buffer to be used by this
function as memory space for storing portions of the device data.
This buffer is passed as the \fIstore\fP argument.
.LP 
The store buffer is a data area managed by \s-2PHIGS\s+2. While the 
application is responsible for creating the initial buffer through a call to 
\s-2CREATE STORE\s+2, \s-2PHIGS\s+2 manages this area such that there is
sufficient memory for the specific inquiry. The pick device data record
within the store buffer is accessed via the pointer returned in \fIpick_data\fP.
.IP \fItype\fP
The workstation type with which the device is associated.
.IP \fIdevice\fP
The device number of the pick device.
See the \fIAvailable Devices\fP section of \s-2INITIALIZE PICK\s+2
for a description of the available devices.
.IP \fIlen\fR
The number of \fIints\fR in the \fIpets\fR output parameter for which the 
application has allocated memory. \fIlen\fR is the number of list elements
that the system can return in \fIpets\(->ints\fR.
If a value of 0 is used here, no data will be returned in the \fIpets\(->ints\fR
list, but the total number of elements will be returned in \fItlen\fR.
.IP \fIst\fR
Starting position of inquiry.  The elements in the list, beginning
with the item number specified by \fIst\fR, are copied sequentially into 
\fIpets\(->ints\fR until \fIpets\(->ints\fR is full
or all the elements have been copied.
.IP \fIstore\fP
The memory buffer \s-2PHIGS\s+2 is to use for storing the information
returned for the Ppick_data structure.  This memory is not used for the data
returned in the Pint_list structure.
This buffer must exist prior to calling this function (see
\s-2CREATE STORE (3P)\s+2).
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
The error indicator.  See the \fIExecution\fP section below for a
description of its use.  See the \fIErrors\fP section below for the
possible values it may return.
.IP \fIpets\fP
Available prompt/echo types.
Pint_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +1i +1.25i
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers        */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.IP
The \fInum_ints\fR component specifies the number of elements in the list.
The \fIints\fR component is a pointer to a list \fInum_ints\fR long.
.IP
The application must allocate memory for \fIlen\fR elements in the
list of \fIints\fR.
.IP \fItlen\fR
A pointer to an integer in which the system returns the total number of elements
in the list.  This is the value required for \fIlen\fR if all elements in the
list are to be returned.
.IP \fIecho_area\fP
A pointer to an object of type Plimit that will represent the echo area of
the device. Plimit is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.nf
.ta .5i   +1i   +1i
.sp .2
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	x_min;	/* x min */
	Pfloat	x_max;	/* x max */
	Pfloat	y_min;	/* y min */
	Pfloat	y_max;	/* y max */
.sp .2
} Plimit;
.IP
.fi
.IP \fIpick_data\fP
A pointer to a pointer to a Ppick_data pointer.
PHIGS assigns this pointer to the location in the Pstore structure that
contains the device's data record contents.
Ppick_data is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +1.0i +1.0i
.nf
typedef union {
.sp .2
	struct {
		Pint	unused;
	} pet_r1;
.sp .2
} Ppick_data;
.fi
.IP \fIpath_order\fP
Pointer to the path order.
Ppath_order is an enumerated type with the following values:
.nf
.ta .5i
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PORDER_TOP_FIRST,
	PORDER_BOTTOM_FIRST
.sp .2
} Ppath_order;
.fi
.SS Execution
\*f returns the default data of the specified pick device.  This data is
stored in the workstation description table associated with the workstation
type.
See \s-2INITIALIZE PICK\s+2 for a description of the prompt/echo types,
echo area, and data record contents, and how to set these values.
.LP
In the event of an error, the \fIerror indicator\fP 
indicates the error number of the error detected, and no other output data
is returned.  If no error is detected, the \fIerror indicator\fP is
set to zero, and the inquired information will be available in the output
parameters.  Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not
invoked when an error is detected by this function.
.SH ERRORS
