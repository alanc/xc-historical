One of the tools used to build the UI for the font server,
/mac/bin/rez, must be executed from the A/UX Macintosh environment.
For this reason I have *not* arranged to automatically build MacFS.
Here's how it goes:

(1) build all the other font stuff

(2) Logon to A/UX from the MacII console and enter the A/UX Mac
environment.

(3) In fonts/server/MacFS do "make".

(4) The successful result of the make is a "hybrid" application:
MacFS. You can start it up in the usual way from the shell, or
double-click on it from the A/UX Finder. A primitive user interface
should appear. The Mac bitmap fonts are now being served :-)

The following steps add the TrueType outline fonts to the A/UX
System File, and add the TrueType renderer to the System Folder (as
an "init").

(1) Copy the file named "TrueType" to "/mac/sys/System Folder" and
to any "personal System Folder" you might have.

(2) Launch (from the shell or by double-clicking) "Font_DA_Mover".

(3) Choose "Open" from the Font_DA_Mover

(4) Choose "Open" from the File Dialog (which should display
"TrueType Fonts" highlighted).

(5) Shift select all the TrueType fonts.

(6) Click on "<< Copy".

(7) Quit from the Font_DA_Mover.

(8) Logout of the A/UX session and then log back in. Start MacFS
again, it will now server both bitmap and TrueType fonts.

Hope you have a chance to try this!
